However, previous research has indicated that many farmers and food producers lack the cybersecurity education they require to identify and mitigate the growing number of threats and risks impacting the industry. This paper presents an ongoing research effort describing a cybersecurity initiative to educate various populations in the farming and agriculture community. The initiative proposes the development and delivery of a ten-module cybersecurity course, to create a more secure workforce, focusing on individuals who, in the past, have received minimal exposure to cybersecurity education initiatives.\nInvestigating The Implications of Cyberattacks Against Precision Agricultural Equipment\t\"Mark Freyhof, \n      \n      George Grispos, \n      \n      Santosh K. Pitla, \n      \n      William Mahoney\"\t2025/03/20\tAs various technologies are integrated and implemented into the food and agricultural industry, it is increasingly important for stakeholders throughout the sector to identify and reduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks associated with these technologies. However, numerous industry and government reports suggest that many farmers and agricultural equipment manufacturers do not fully understand the cyber threats posed by modern agricultural technologies, including CAN bus-driven farming equipment. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by attempting to quantify the cybersecurity risks associated with cyberattacks on farming equipment that utilize CAN bus technology. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents a hypothetical case study, using real-world data, to illustrate the specific and wider impacts of a cyberattack on a CAN bus-driven fertilizer applicator employed in row-crop farming. Second, it establishes a foundation for future research on quantifying cybersecurity risks related to agricultural machinery.\nInternet of Things-Based Smart Precision Farming in Soilless Agriculture: Opportunities and Challenges for Global Food Security\t\"Monica Dutta, \n      \n      Deepali Gupta, \n      \n      Sumegh Tharewal, \n      \n      Deepam Goyal, \n      \n      Jasminder Kaur Sandhu, \n      \n      Manjit Kaur, \n      \n      Ahmad Ali Alzubi, \n      \n      Jazem Mutared Alanazi\"\t2025/03/14\tThe rapid growth of the global population and the continuous decline in cultivable land pose significant threats to food security. This challenge worsens as climate change further reduces the availability of farmland. Soilless agriculture, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, offers a sustainable solution by enabling efficient crop cultivation in controlled environments. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart precision farming improves resource efficiency, automates environmental control, and ensures stable and high-yield crop production. IoT-enabled smart farming systems utilize real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and automation to optimize water and nutrient usage while minimizing human intervention. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of IoT-based soilless farming, highlighting its role in sustainable agriculture, urban farming, and global food security. These advanced farming methods ensure greater productivity, resource conservation, and year-round cultivation. However, they also face challenges such as high initial investment, technological dependency, and energy consumption. Through a comprehensive study, bibliometric analysis, and comparative analysis, this research highlights current trends and research gaps. It also outlines future directions for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation and scalability in IoT-driven soilless agriculture. By emphasizing the benefits of vertical farming and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)-enabled soilless techniques, this paper supports informed decision-making to address food security challenges and promote sustainable agricultural innovations.\nAgent-Based Simulation of UAV Battery Recharging for IoT Applications: Precision Agriculture, Disaster Recovery, and Dengue Vector Control\t\"Leonardo Grando, \n      \n      Juan Fernando Galindo Jaramillo, \n      \n      Jose Roberto Emiliano Leite, \n      \n      Edson Luiz Ursini\"\t2025/03/16\tThe low battery autonomy of Unnamed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) can make smart farming (precision agriculture), disaster recovery, and the fighting against dengue vector applications difficult. This article considers two approaches, first enumerating the characteristics observed in these three IoT application types and then modeling an UAV's battery recharge coordination using the Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) approach. In this way, we propose that each drone inside the swarm does not communicate concerning this recharge coordination decision, reducing energy usage and permitting remote usage. A total of 6000 simulations were run to evaluate how two proposed policies, the BaseLine (BL) and ChargerThershold (CT) coordination recharging policy, behave in 30 situations regarding how each simulation sets conclude the simulation runs and how much time they work until recharging results. CT policy shows more reliable results in extreme system usage. This work conclusion presents the potential of these three IoT applications to achieve their perpetual service without communication between drones and ground stations. This work can be a baseline for future policies and simulation parameter enhancements.\nReliable and Cost-Efficient IoT Connectivity for Smart Agriculture: A Comparative Study of LPWAN, 5G, and Hybrid Connectivity Models\t\"Mohamed Shabeer Mohamed Rafi, \n      \n      Mehran Behjati, \n      \n      Ahmad Sahban Rafsanjani\"\t2025/03/14\tThe integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart agriculture has transformed farming practices by enabling real time monitoring, data-driven decision making, and automation.

However, ensuring reliable connectivity in diverse agricultural environments remains a critical challenge. This paper analyzes the performance trade offs between Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), specifically LoRaWAN, NBIoT, and Sigfox and cellular networks (4G and 5G) in agricultural applications. Beyond a comprehensive literature review, this study evaluates hybrid LPWAN and 5G architectures that integrate the strengths of both network types to enhance cost-efficiency and connectivity reliability. Using real-world case studies, the findings demonstrate that hybrid LPWAN and 5G models can reduce connectivity costs by up to 30% while significantly improving network reliability in remote agricultural settings.

Visual feature matching is crucial to vision-based pipelines but remains particularly challenging in natural outdoor settings due to perceptual aliasing. We address this issue in vineyards, where repetitive vine trunks and other natural elements generate ambiguous descriptors that hinder reliable feature matching. We hypothesise that semantic information tied to keypoint positions can alleviate perceptual aliasing by enhancing keypoint descriptor distinctiveness. To this end, we introduce a keypoint semantic integration technique that improves the descriptors in semantically meaningful regions within the image, enabling more accurate differentiation even among visually similar local features. We validate this approach in two vineyard perception tasks: (i) relative pose estimation and (ii) visual localisation. Across all tested keypoint types and descriptors, our method improves matching accuracy by 12.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness over multiple months in challenging vineyard conditions.\nForce Aware Branch Manipulation To Assist Agricultural Tasks\t\"Madhav Rijal, \n      \n      Rashik Shrestha, \n      \n      Trevor Smith, \n      \n      Yu Gu\"\t2025/03/11\tThis study presents a methodology to safely manipulate branches to aid various agricultural tasks. Humans in a real agricultural environment often manipulate branches to perform agricultural tasks effectively, but current agricultural robots lack this capability. This proposed strategy to manipulate branches can aid in different precision agriculture tasks, such as fruit picking in dense foliage, pollinating flowers under occlusion, and moving overhanging vines and branches for navigation. The proposed method modifies RRT* to plan a path that satisfies the branch geometric constraints and obeys branch deformable characteristics. Re-planning is done to obtain a path that helps the robot exert force within a desired range so that branches are not damaged during manipulation. Experimentally, this method achieved a success rate of 78% across 50 trials, successfully moving a branch from different starting points to a target region.\nA Novel Control Strategy for Offset Points Tracking in the Context of Agricultural Robotics\t\"Stephane Ngnepiepaye Wembe, \n      \n      Vincent Rousseau, \n      \n      Johann Laconte, \n      \n      Roland Lenain\"\t2025/03/06\tIn this paper, we present a novel method to control a rigidly connected location on the vehicle, such as a point on the implement in case of agricultural tasks. Agricultural robots are transforming modern farming by enabling precise and efficient operations, replacing humans in arduous tasks while reducing the use of chemicals. Traditionnaly, path_following algorithms are designed to guide the vehicle's center along a predefined trajetory. However, since the actual agronomic task is performed by the implement, it is essential to control a specific point on the implement itself rather than vehicle's center. As such, we present in this paper two approaches for achieving the control of an offset point on the robot. The first approach adapts existing control laws, initially inteded for rear axle's midpoint, to manage the desired lateral deviation. The second approach employs backstepping control techniques to create a control law that directly targets the implement. We conduct real-world experiments, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches for offset points control, and demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods.\nAgroLLM: Connecting Farmers and Agricultural Practices through Large Language Models for Enhanced Knowledge Transfer and Practical Application\t\"Dinesh Jackson Samuel, \n      \n      Inna Skarga-Bandurova, \n      \n      David Sikolia, \n      \n      Muhammad Awais\"\t2025/02/27\tAgroLLM is an AI-powered chatbot designed to enhance knowledge-sharing and education in agriculture using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework.

This paper addresses EDVRP in agriculture, focusing on multi-parameter vehicle planning for irregularly shaped fields. To address the limitations of traditional methods, such as heuristic approaches, which often overlook field geometry and entrance constraints, we propose a Joint Probability Distribution Sampling Neural Network (JPDS-NN) to effectively solve the EDVRP. The network uses an encoder-decoder architecture with graph transformers and attention mechanisms to model routing as a Markov Decision Process, and is trained via reinforcement learning for efficient and rapid end-to-end planning. Experimental results indicate that JPDS-NN reduces travel distances by 48.4-65.4%, lowers fuel consumption by 14.0-17.6%, and computes two orders of magnitude faster than baseline methods, while demonstrating 15-25% superior performance in dynamic arrangement scenarios. Ablation studies validate the necessity of cross-attention and pre-training. The framework enables scalable, intelligent routing for large-scale farming under dynamic constraints.\nLanguage-Guided Object Search in Agricultural Environments\t\"Advaith Balaji, \n      \n      Saket Pradhan, \n      \n      Dmitry Berenson\"\t2025/03/02\tCreating robots that can assist in farms and gardens can help reduce the mental and physical workload experienced by farm workers. We tackle the problem of object search in a farm environment, providing a method that allows a robot to semantically reason about the location of an unseen target object among a set of previously seen objects in the environment using a Large Language Model (LLM). We leverage object-to-object semantic relationships to plan a path through the environment that will allow us to accurately and efficiently locate our target object while also reducing the overall distance traveled, without needing high-level room or area-level semantic relationships. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed a current state-of-the-art baseline and our ablations. Our offline testing yielded an average path efficiency of 84%, reflecting how closely the predicted path aligns with the ideal path. Upon deploying our system on the Boston Dynamics Spot robot in a real-world farm environment, we found that our system had a success rate of 80%, with a success weighted by path length of 0.67, which demonstrates a reasonable trade-off between task success and path efficiency under real-world conditions.

Based upon a cable driven robot architecture, by sharing the same roller-driven cable set with modular robotic arms, a fast-switching clamping mechanism allows each CAFE to clamp onto or release from the moving cables, enabling both independent and synchronized movement across the workspace. The methods developed to enable this system include the mechanical design, precise position control and a dynamic model for the spring-mass liked system, ensuring accurate and stable movement of the robotic arms. The system's scalability is further explored by studying the tension and sag in the cables to maintain performance as more robotic arms are deployed. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in tasks including pick-and-place showing its potential to contribute to agricultural automation.\nPlantPal: Leveraging Precision Agriculture Robots to Facilitate Remote Engagement in Urban Gardening\t\"Albin Zeqiri, \n      \n      Julian Britten, \n      \n      Clara Schramm, \n      \n      Pascal Jansen, \n      \n      Michael Rietzler, \n      \n      Enrico Rukzio\"\t2025/02/26\tUrban gardening is widely recognized for its numerous health and environmental benefits. However, the lack of suitable garden spaces, demanding daily schedules and limited gardening expertise present major roadblocks for citizens looking to engage in urban gardening. While prior research has explored smart home solutions to support urban gardeners, these approaches currently do not fully address these practical barriers. In this paper, we present PlantPal, a system that enables the cultivation of garden spaces irrespective of one's location, expertise level, or time constraints. PlantPal enables the shared operation of a precision agriculture robot (PAR) that is equipped with garden tools and a multi-camera system. Insights from a 3-week deployment (N=18) indicate that PlantPal facilitated the integration of gardening tasks into daily routines, fostered a sense of connection with one's field, and provided an engaging experience despite the remote setting.

In precision agriculture, accurate and synchronized data collection is crucial for effective analysis and decision making. Using principles of information theory, we can define conditions and parameters that influence the efficient transmission and processing of information. Existing technologies have limitations in maintaining consistent time references, handling node failures, and unreliable communication links, leading to inaccurate data readings. Reliable data storage is demanding now-a-days for storing data on local monitoring station as well as in online live server. Sometime internet is not working properly due to congestion and there is frequent packet loss. Current solutions often synchronize records based on database timestamps, leading to record duplication and waste storage. Both databases synchronize each other after internet restoration. By providing synchronization among nodes and data, accuracy and storage will be saved in IoT based WSNs for precision agriculture applications. A prototype Node-MCU internal memory is used as a resource for achieving data synchronization. This proposed work generates record ID from Node MCU EEPROM which helps in records synchronization if there is any packet loss at the local server or at the online server to maintain synchronization accuracy despite unreliable communication links. Experiment shows that for a particular duration Node MCU generated 2364 packets and packet loss at local server was 08 and at online server was 174 packets. Results shows that after synchronization 99.87% packets were synchronized. Using previous technique of timestamp, the redundancy was 70% which reduced to 0% using our proposed technique.\nSelf-Supervised Data Generation for Precision Agriculture: Blending Simulated Environments with Real Imagery\t\"Leonardo Saraceni, \n      \n      Ionut Marian Motoi, \n      \n      Daniele Nardi, \n      \n      Thomas Alessandro Ciarfuglia\"\t2025/02/25\tIn precision agriculture, the scarcity of labeled data and significant covariate shifts pose unique challenges for training machine learning models. This scarcity is particularly problematic due to the dynamic nature of the environment and the evolving appearance of agricultural subjects as living things. We propose a novel system for generating realistic synthetic data to address these challenges. Utilizing a vineyard simulator based on the Unity engine, our system employs a cut-and-paste technique with geometrical consistency considerations to produce accurate photo-realistic images and labels from synthetic environments to train detection algorithms. This approach generates diverse data samples across various viewpoints and lighting conditions. We demonstrate considerable performance improvements in training a state-of-the-art detector by applying our method to table grapes cultivation. The combination of techniques can be easily automated, an increasingly important consideration for adoption in agricultural practice.\nA survey of datasets for computer vision in agriculture\t\"Nico Heider, \n      \n      Lorenz Gunreben, \n      \n      Sebastian Zürner, \n      \n      Martin Schieck\"\t2025/02/24\tIn agricultural research, there has been a recent surge in the amount of Computer Vision (CV) focused work. But unlike general CV research, large high-quality public datasets are sparsely available. This can be partially attributed to the high variability between different agricultural tasks, crops and environments as well as the complexity of data collection, but it is also influenced by the reticence to publish datasets by many authors. This, as well as the lack of a widely used agricultural data repository, are impactful factors that hinder research in applied CV for agriculture as well as the usage of agricultural data in general-purpose CV research. In this survey, we provide a large number of high-quality datasets of images taken on fields. Overall, we find 45 datasets, which are listed in this paper as well as in an online catalog on the project website: https://smartfarminglab.github.io/field_dataset_survey/.\nAutonomous Agricultural Monitoring with Aerial Drones and RF Energy-Harvesting Sensor Tags\t\"Paul S. Kudyba, \n      \n      Haijian Sun\"\t2025/02/21\tIn precision agriculture and plant science, there is an increasing demand for wireless sensors that are easy to deploy, maintain, and monitor. This paper investigates a novel approach that leverages recent advances in extremely low-power wireless communication and sensing, as well as the rapidly increasing availability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. By mounting a specialized wireless payload on a UAV, battery-less sensor tags can harvest wireless beacon signals emitted from the drone, dramatically reducing the cost per sensor. These tags can measure environmental information such as temperature and humidity, then encrypt and transmit the data in the range of several meters. An experimental implementation was constructed at AERPAW, an NSF-funded wireless aerial drone research platform. While ground-based tests confirmed reliable sensor operation and data collection, airborne trials encountered wireless interference that impeded successfully detecting tag data. Despite these challenges, our results suggest further refinements could improve reliability and advance precision agriculture and agrarian research.\nWeedVision: Multi-Stage Growth and Classification of Weeds using DETR and RetinaNet for Precision Agriculture\t\"Taminul Islam, \n      \n      Toqi Tahamid Sarker, \n      \n      Khaled R Ahmed, \n      \n      Cristiana Bernardi Rankrape, \n      \n      Karla Gage\"\t2025/02/16\tWeed management remains a critical challenge in agriculture, where weeds compete with crops for essential resources, leading to significant yield losses.

Accurate detection of weeds at various growth stages is crucial for effective management yet challenging for farmers, as it requires identifying different species at multiple growth phases. This research addresses these challenges by utilizing advanced object detection models, specifically, the Detection Transformer (DETR) with a ResNet50 backbone and RetinaNet with a ResNeXt101 backbone, to identify and classify 16 weed species of economic concern across 174 classes, spanning their 11 weeks growth stages from seedling to maturity. A robust dataset comprising 203,567 images was developed, meticulously labeled by species and growth stage. The models were rigorously trained and evaluated, with RetinaNet demonstrating superior performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.907 on the training set and 0.904 on the test set, compared to DETR's mAP of 0.854 and 0.840, respectively. RetinaNet also outperformed DETR in recall and inference speed of 7.28 FPS, making it more suitable for real time applications. Both models showed improved accuracy as plants matured. This research provides crucial insights for developing precise, sustainable, and automated weed management strategies, paving the way for real time species specific detection systems and advancing AI-assisted agriculture through continued innovation in model development and early detection accuracy.\nEnd-to-end pipeline for simultaneous temperature estimation and super resolution of low-cost uncooled infrared camera frames for precision agriculture applications\t\"Navot Oz, \n      \n      Nir Sochen, \n      \n      David Mendlovic, \n      \n      Iftach Klapp\"\t2025/02/18\tRadiometric infrared (IR) imaging is a valuable technique for remote-sensing applications in precision agriculture, such as irrigation monitoring, crop health assessment, and yield estimation. Low-cost uncooled non-radiometric IR cameras offer new implementations in agricultural monitoring. However, these cameras have inherent drawbacks that limit their usability, such as low spatial resolution, spatially variant nonuniformity, and lack of radiometric calibration. In this article, we present an end-to-end pipeline for temperature estimation and super resolution of frames captured by a low-cost uncooled IR camera. The pipeline consists of two main components: a deep-learning-based temperature-estimation module, and a deep-learning-based super-resolution module. The temperature-estimation module learns to map the raw gray level IR images to the corresponding temperature maps while also correcting for nonuniformity. The super-resolution module uses a deep-learning network to enhance the spatial resolution of the IR images by scale factors of x2 and x4. We evaluated the performance of the pipeline on both simulated and real-world agricultural datasets composing of roughly 20,000 frames of various crops. For the simulated data, the results were on par with the real-world data with sub-degree accuracy. For the real data, the proposed pipeline was compared to a high-end radiometric thermal camera, and achieved sub-degree accuracy. The results of the real data are on par with the simulated data. The proposed pipeline can enable various applications in precision agriculture that require high quality thermal information from low-cost IR cameras.\nWeedsGalore: A Multispectral and Multitemporal UAV-based Dataset for Crop and Weed Segmentation in Agricultural Maize Fields\t\"Ekin Celikkan, \n      \n      Timo Kunzmann, \n      \n      Yertay Yeskaliyev, \n      \n      Sibylle Itzerott, \n      \n      Nadja Klein, \n      \n      Martin Herold\"\t2025/02/18\tWeeds are one of the major reasons for crop yield loss but current weeding practices fail to manage weeds in an efficient and targeted manner. Effective weed management is especially important for crops with high worldwide production such as maize, to maximize crop yield for meeting increasing global demands. Advances in near-sensing and computer vision enable the development of new tools for weed management. Specifically, state-of-the-art segmentation models, coupled with novel sensing technologies, can facilitate timely and accurate weeding and monitoring systems. However, learning-based approaches require annotated data and show a lack of generalization to aerial imaging for different crops. We present a novel dataset for semantic and instance segmentation of crops and weeds in agricultural maize fields. The multispectral UAV-based dataset contains images with RGB, red-edge, and near-infrared bands, a large number of plant instances, dense annotations for maize and four weed classes, and is multitemporal. We provide extensive baseline results for both tasks, including probabilistic methods to quantify prediction uncertainty, improve model calibration, and demonstrate the approach's applicability to out-of-distribution data. The results show the effectiveness of the two additional bands compared to RGB only, and better performance in our target domain than models trained on existing datasets. We hope our dataset advances research on methods and operational systems for fine-grained weed identification, enhancing the robustness and applicability of UAV-based weed management.

In controlled laboratory settings, both the traditional HSV (Hue Saturation Value) transformation and the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model were employed. However, only YOLOv8 was utilised in outdoor experiments, as the HSV transformation was not capable of accurately drawing fruit contours. Experiments include ten distinct fruit patterns with six apples and six oranges. A grid structure for homography (perspective) transformation was employed to convert detected midpoints into 3D world coordinates. The experiments evaluated detection and localisation under varying lighting and background disturbances, revealing accurate performance indoors, but significant challenges outdoors. Our results show that indoor experiments using YOLOv8 achieved 100% detection accuracy, while outdoor conditions decreased performance, with an average accuracy of 69.15% for YOLOv8 under direct sunlight. The study demonstrates that real-world applications reveal significant limitations due to changing lighting, background disturbances, and colour and shape variability. These findings underscore the need for further refinement of algorithms and sensors to enhance the robustness of robotic harvesters for agricultural use.\nMultispectral Remote Sensing for Weed Detection in West Australian Agricultural Lands\t\"Haitian Wang, \n      \n      Muhammad Ibrahim, \n      \n      Yumeng Miao, \n      \n      D ustin Severtson, \n      \n      Atif Mansoor, \n      \n      Ajmal S. Mian\"\t2025/02/12\tThe Kondinin region in Western Australia faces significant agricultural challenges due to pervasive weed infestations, causing economic losses and ecological impacts. This study constructs a tailored multispectral remote sensing dataset and an end-to-end framework for weed detection to advance precision agriculture practices. Unmanned aerial vehicles were used to collect raw multispectral data from two experimental areas (E2 and E8) over four years, covering 0.6046 km^{2} and ground truth annotations were created with GPS-enabled vehicles to manually label weeds and crops. The dataset is specifically designed for agricultural applications in Western Australia. We propose an end-to-end framework for weed detection that includes extensive preprocessing steps, such as denoising, radiometric calibration, image alignment, orthorectification, and stitching. The proposed method combines vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI) with multispectral channels to form classification features, and employs several deep learning models to identify weeds based on the input features. Among these models, ResNet achieves the highest performance, with a weed detection accuracy of 0.9213, an F1-Score of 0.8735, an mIOU of 0.7888, and an mDC of 0.8865, validating the efficacy of the dataset and the proposed weed detection method.\nDoes the financialization of agricultural commodities impact food security? An empirical investigation\t\"Manogna R. L., \n      \n      Nishil Kulkarni\"\t2025/02/08\tThe financialization of agricultural commodities and its impact on food security has become an increasing concern. This study empirically investigates the role of financialization in global food markets and its policy implications for a stable and secure food system. Using panel data regression models, moderating effects models, and panel regression with a threshold variable, we analyze wheat, maize, and soybean futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. We incorporate data on annual trading volume, open interest contracts, and their ratio. The sample consists of five developed countries (United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany) and seven developing countries (China, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand), covering the period 2000 to 2021. The Human Development Index (HDI) serves as a threshold variable to differentiate the impact across countries. Our findings indicate that the financialization of agricultural commodities has negatively affected global food security, with wheat and soybean showing a greater adverse impact than maize. The effects are more pronounced in developing countries. Additionally, we find that monetary policy has the potential to mitigate these negative effects. These results provide insights for policymakers to design strategies that ensure a secure and accessible global food supply.\nAgricultural Field Boundary Detection through Integration of \"Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) Super Pixels\" and \"Canny Edge Detection Method\"\tArtughrul Gayibov\t2025/02/06\tEfficient use of cultivated areas is a necessary factor for sustainable development of agriculture and ensuring food security. Along with the rapid development of satellite technologies in developed countries, new methods are being searched for accurate and operational identification of cultivated areas. In this context, identification of cropland boundaries based on spectral analysis of data obtained from satellite images is considered one of the most optimal and accurate methods in modern agriculture. This article proposes a new approach to determine the suitability and green index of cultivated areas using satellite data obtained through the \"Google Earth Engine\" (GEE) platform. In this approach, two powerful algorithms, \"SNIC (Simple Non-Iterative Clustering) Super Pixels\" and \"Canny Edge Detection Method\", are combined. The SNIC algorithm combines pixels in a satellite image into larger regions (super pixels) with similar characteristics, thereby providing better image analysis. The Canny Edge Detection Method detects sharp changes (edges) in the image to determine the precise boundaries of agricultural fields. This study, carried out using high-resolution multispectral data from the Sentinel-2 satellite and the Google Earth Engine JavaScript API, has shown that the proposed method is effective in accurately and reliably classifying randomly selected agricultural fields.

However, the adoption of such technologies is severely limited by the lack of broadband connectivity in rural areas. We argue that farming applications do not require permanent always-on connectivity. Instead, farming activity and digital agriculture applications follow seasonal rhythms of agriculture. Therefore, the need for connectivity is highly localized in time and space. We introduce BYON, a new connectivity model for high bandwidth agricultural applications that relies on emerging connectivity solutions like citizens broadband radio service (CBRS) and satellite networks. BYON creates an agile connectivity solution that can be moved along a farm to create spatio-temporal connectivity bubbles. BYON incorporates a new gateway design that reacts to the presence of crops and optimizes coverage in agricultural settings. We evaluate BYON in a production farm and demonstrate its benefits.\nEcoWeedNet: A Lightweight and Automated Weed Detection Method for Sustainable Next-Generation Agricultural Consumer Electronics\t\"Omar H. Khater, \n      \n      Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui, \n      \n      M. Shamim Hossain\"\t2025/01/31\tSustainable agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring world food security for consumers. A critical challenge faced by sustainable precision agriculture is weed growth, as weeds share essential resources with the crops, such as water, soil nutrients, and sunlight, which notably affect crop yields. The traditional methods employed to combat weeds include the usage of chemical herbicides and manual weed removal methods. However, these could damage the environment and pose health hazards. The adoption of automated computer vision technologies and ground agricultural consumer electronic vehicles in precision agriculture offers sustainable, low-carbon solutions. However, prior works suffer from issues such as low accuracy and precision and high computational expense. This work proposes EcoWeedNet, a novel model with enhanced weed detection performance without adding significant computational complexity, aligning with the goals of low-carbon agricultural practices. Additionally, our model is lightweight and optimal for deployment on ground-based consumer electronic agricultural vehicles and robots. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the CottonWeedDet12 benchmark dataset reflecting real-world scenarios. EcoWeedNet achieves performance close to that of large models yet with much fewer parameters. (approximately 4.21% of the parameters and 6.59% of the GFLOPs of YOLOv4). This work contributes effectively to the development of automated weed detection methods for next-generation agricultural consumer electronics featuring lower energy consumption and lower carbon footprint. This work paves the way forward for sustainable agricultural consumer technologies.\nAgricultural Industry Initiatives on Autonomy: How collaborative initiatives of VDMA and AEF can facilitate complexity in domain crossing harmonization needs\t\"Georg Happich, \n      \n      Alexander Grever, \n      \n      Julius Schöning\"\t2025/01/29\tThe agricultural industry is undergoing a significant transformation with the increasing adoption of autonomous technologies.

This research presents a framework for IoT-enabled smart agriculture, leveraging Raspberry Pi-based technology to provide real-time monitoring of weather and environmental conditions. The framework integrates sensors for temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and pressure, connected via an MCP3208 analog-to-digital converter. Data is displayed on an LCD for immediate feedback and transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for centralized storage, analysis, and remote access through a mobile app or web interface. Farmers can leverage this framework to optimize irrigation schedules and improve crop productivity through actionable insights derived from real-time and forecasted data on rainfall, temperature, pressure and soil moisture. Additionally, the system incorporates predictive weather forecasting to dynamically control sensor activity, reducing energy consumption and extending sensor lifespan. Simulated using Proteus, the proposed framework demonstrates significant potential to mitigate the impacts of unpredictable weather by reducing water consumption, improving forecasting accuracy, and boosting productivity.\nAn Analysis of the Interdependence Between Peanut and Other Agricultural Commodities in China's Futures Market\tSuke Li\t2025/02/25\tThis study analyzes historical data from five agricultural commodities in the Chinese futures market to explore the correlation, cointegration, and Granger causality between Peanut futures and related futures. Multivariate linear regression models are constructed for prices and logarithmic returns, while dynamic relationships are examined using VAR and DCC-EGARCH models. The results reveal a significant dynamic linkage between Peanut and Soybean Oil futures through DCC-EGARCH, whereas the VAR model suggests limited influence from other futures. Additionally, the application of MLP, CNN, and LSTM neural networks for price prediction highlights the critical role of time step configurations in forecasting accuracy. These findings provide valuable insights into the interconnectedness of agricultural futures markets and the efficacy of advanced modeling techniques in financial analysis.\nIntegration of IoT- AI powered local weather forecasting: A Game-Changer for Agriculture\t\"Suman Kumar Das, \n      \n      Pujyasmita Nayak\"\t2024/12/22\tThe dynamic environment context necessitates harnessing digital technologies, including artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, to supply high-resolution, real-time meteorological data to support agricultural decision-making and improve overall farm productivity and sustainability. This study investigates the potential application of various AI-powered, IoT-based, low-cost platforms for local weather forecasting to enable smart farming. Despite the increasing demand for this topic, a few promising studies have explored this area. This paper developed a conceptual research framework based on a systematic review of relevant literature and employed a case study method to validate the framework. The framework comprised five key components: the Data Acquisition Layer, Data Storage Layer, Data Processing Layer, Application Layer, and Decision-Making Layer. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the integration of AI-ML and IoT techniques for weather prediction tasks to support agriculture, and the incorporation of IoT technologies that provide real-time, high-resolution meteorological data, representing a step forward. Furthermore, this paper discusses key research gaps, such as the significant obstacles impeding the adoption of AI in agriculture and local weather forecasting, including the lack of straightforward solutions and the lack of digital skills among farmers, particularly those in rural areas. Further empirical research is needed to enhance the existing frameworks and address these challenges.\nTo Measure or Not: A Cost-Sensitive, Selective Measuring Environment for Agricultural Management Decisions with Reinforcement Learning\t\"Hilmy Baja, \n      \n      Michiel Kallenberg, \n      \n      Ioannis N. Athanasiadis\"\t2025/01/22\tFarmers rely on in-field observations to make well-informed crop management decisions to maximize profit and minimize adverse environmental impact. However, obtaining real-world crop state measurements is labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. In most cases, it is not feasible to gather crop state measurements before every decision moment. Moreover, in previous research pertaining to farm management optimization, these observations are often assumed to be readily available without any cost, which is unrealistic. Hence, enabling optimization without the need to have temporally complete crop state observations is important. An approach to that problem is to include measuring as part of decision making. As a solution, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to recommend opportune moments to simultaneously measure crop features and apply nitrogen fertilizer. With realistic considerations, we design an RL environment with explicit crop feature measuring costs. While balancing costs, we find that an RL agent, trained with recurrent PPO, discovers adaptive measuring policies that follow critical crop development stages, with results aligned by what domain experts would consider a sensible approach. Our results highlight the importance of measuring when crop feature measurements are not readily available.\nEfficient and Safe Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicle Headland Turning in Cluttered Orchard Environments\t\"Peng Wei, \n      \n      Chen Peng, \n      \n      Wenwu Lu, \n      \n      Yuankai Zhu, \n      \n      Stavros Vougioukas, \n      \n      Zhenghao Fei, \n      \n      Zhikang Ge\"\t2025/01/17\tAutonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs), including field robots and autonomous tractors, are becoming essential in modern farming by improving efficiency and reducing labor costs.

As a result of this, the level of arable land is decreasing, as well as residential houses and industrial factories. The food crisis is becoming the main threat for us in the upcoming days. Because on the one hand, the population is increasing, and on the other hand, the amount of food crop production is decreasing due to the attack of diseases. Rice is one of the most significant cultivated crops since it provides food for more than half of the world's population. Bangladesh is dependent on rice (Oryza sativa) as a vital crop for its agriculture, but it faces a significant problem as a result of the ongoing decline in rice yield brought on by common diseases. Early disease detection is the main difficulty in rice crop cultivation. In this paper, we proposed our own dataset, which was collected from the Bangladesh field, and also applied deep learning and transfer learning models for the evaluation of the datasets. We elaborately explain our dataset and also give direction for further research work to serve society using this dataset. We applied a light CNN model and pre-trained InceptionNet-V2, EfficientNet-V2, and MobileNet-V2 models, which achieved 91.5% performance for the EfficientNet-V2 model of this work. The results obtained assaulted other models and even exceeded approaches that are considered to be part of the state of the art. It has been demonstrated by this study that it is possible to precisely and effectively identify diseases that affect rice leaves using this unbiased datasets. After analysis of the performance of different models, the proposed datasets are significant for the society for research work to provide solutions for decreasing rice leaf disease.\nCoverage Path Planning in Precision Agriculture: Algorithms, Applications, and Key Benefits\t\"Jahid Chowdhury Choton, \n      \n      William H. Hsu\"\t2025/01/08\tCoverage path planning (CPP) is the task of computing an optimal path within a region to completely scan or survey an area of interest using one or multiple mobile robots. Robots equipped with sensors and cameras can collect vast amounts of data on crop health, soil conditions, and weather patterns. Advanced analytics can then be applied to this data to make informed decisions, improving overall farm management. In this paper, we will demonstrate one approach to find the optimal coverage path of an agricultural field using a single robot, and one using multiple robots. For the single robot, we used a wavefront coverage algorithm that generates a sequence of locations that the robot needs to follow. For the multi-robot approach, the proposed approach consists of two steps: dividing the agricultural field into convex polygonal areas to optimally distribute them among the robots, and generating an optimal coverage path to ensure minimum coverage time for each of the polygonal areas.\nAutonomous Navigation of 4WIS4WID Agricultural Field Mobile Robot using Deep Reinforcement Learning\t\"Tom Baby, \n      \n      Mahendra Kumar Gohil, \n      \n      Bishakh Bhattacharya\"\t2024/12/25\tIn the futuristic agricultural fields compatible with Agriculture 4.0, robots are envisaged to navigate through crops to perform functions like pesticide spraying and fruit harvesting, which are complex tasks due to factors such as non-geometric internal obstacles, space constraints, and outdoor conditions. In this paper, we attempt to employ Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve the problem of 4WIS4WID mobile robot navigation in a structured, automated agricultural field. This paper consists of three sections: parameterization of four-wheel steering configurations, crop row tracking using DRL, and autonomous navigation of 4WIS4WID mobile robot using DRL through multiple crop rows. We show how to parametrize various configurations of four-wheel steering to two variables. This includes symmetric four-wheel steering, zero-turn, and an additional steering configuration that allows the 4WIS4WID mobile robot to move laterally. Using DRL, we also followed an irregularly shaped crop row with symmetric four-wheel steering. In the multiple crop row simulation environment, with the help of waypoints, we effectively performed point-to-point navigation.

This issue is considered to be the most important challenge for the next generation of agriculture due to the diminishing natural resources, the limited arable land, and unpredictable climatic conditions caused by climate change. In this paper, we employ emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve operational efficiency and productivity in the agricultural sector. Specifically, we propose an edge computing-based explainable crop recommendation system, AgroXAI, which suggests suitable crops for a region based on weather and soil conditions. In this system, we provide local and global explanations of ML model decisions with methods such as ELI5, LIME, SHAP, which we integrate into ML models. More importantly, we provide regional alternative crop recommendations with the counterfactual explainability method. In this way, we envision that our proposed AgroXAI system will be a platform that provides regional crop diversity in the next generation agriculture.\nGeographic distribution of the global agricultural workforce every decade for the years 2000-2100\t\"Naia Ormaza-Zulueta, \n      \n      Steve Miller, \n      \n      Zia Mehrabi\"\t2024/12/23\tAgricultural workers play a vital role in the global economy and food security by cultivating, transporting, and processing food for populations worldwide. Despite their importance, detailed spatial data on the global agricultural workforce have remained scarce. Here, we present a new gridded dataset that maps the global distribution of agricultural workers for every decade over the years 2000-2100, distributed at 0.083×\\times0.083 degrees resolution, roughly ∼\\sim10km×\\times10km at the Equator. The dataset is developed using an empirical modeling framework relying on generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) that integrate socioeconomic variables, including gross domestic product per capita, total population, rural population size, and agricultural land use. The predictions are consistent with Shared Socio-economic Pathways and we distribute full time series data for all SSPs 1 to 5. This dataset opens new avenues for future research on labour force health, productivity and risk, and could be very useful for developing informed, forward-looking strategies that address the challenges of climate resilience in agriculture.

To assess the effectiveness of these mitigation policies, statistical methods must account for the heterogeneous impact of policies across different countries. We propose a Bayesian approach that combines the multinomial logit model, which is suitable for compositional land-use data, with a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) prior to cluster regions with similar policy impacts. To simultaneously control for other relevant factors, we distinguish between cluster-specific and global covariates, coining this approach the Bayesian nonparametric partial clustering model. We develop a novel and efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, leveraging recent advances in the Bayesian literature. Using economic, geographic, and subsidy-related data from 22 EU member states, we examine the effectiveness of policies influencing land-use decisions across Europe and highlight the diversity of the problem.

However, unlike urban environments, agricultural fields impose distinct and unique challenges on autonomous robotic systems, such as the unstructured and dynamic nature of the environment, the rough and uneven terrain, and the resulting non-smooth robot motion. To address these challenges, this work introduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for autonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural environments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry algorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping module that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for selective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to prioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted points and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in odometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art methods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments featuring various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles. Results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation and mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural settings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and accumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational efficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods. The source code of the developed method and the associated field dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/AG-LOAM.\nAgri-LLaVA: Knowledge-Infused Large Multimodal Assistant on Agricultural Pests and Diseases\t\"Liqiong Wang, \n      \n      Teng Jin, \n      \n      Jinyu Yang, \n      \n      Ales Leonardis, \n      \n      Fangyi Wang, \n      \n      Feng Zheng\"\t2024/12/04\tIn the general domain, large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advancements, yet challenges persist in applying them to specific fields, especially agriculture. As the backbone of the global economy, agriculture confronts numerous challenges, with pests and diseases being particularly concerning due to their complexity, variability, rapid spread, and high resistance. This paper specifically addresses these issues. We construct the first multimodal instruction-following dataset in the agricultural domain, covering over 221 types of pests and diseases with approximately 400,000 data entries. This dataset aims to explore and address the unique challenges in pest and disease control. Based on this dataset, we propose a knowledge-infused training method to develop Agri-LLaVA, an agricultural multimodal conversation system. To accelerate progress in this field and inspire more researchers to engage, we design a diverse and challenging evaluation benchmark for agricultural pests and diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that Agri-LLaVA excels in agricultural multimodal conversation and visual understanding, providing new insights and approaches to address agricultural pests and diseases. By open-sourcing our dataset and model, we aim to promote research and development in LMMs within the agricultural domain and make significant contributions to tackle the challenges of agricultural pests and diseases.

To further address the agriculture knowledge-based dataset limitation problem, we propose MM-LUCAS, a multimodal agriculture dataset, that includes 1,784 landscape images, segmentation masks, depth maps, and detailed annotations (geographical location, country, date, land cover and land use taxonomic details, quality scores, aesthetic scores, etc), based on the Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) dataset, which contains comparable statistics on land use and land cover for the European Union (EU) territory.

Regenerative agricultural practices enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thus improving soil health and sequestering carbon. A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture practices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is affected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors and farm management practices. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex multi-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil health and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data (e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland information and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that integrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized analysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices across California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity may mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather conditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally, implementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants, policymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience.\nPath Tracking Hybrid A* For Autonomous Agricultural Vehicles\t\"Mingke Lu, \n      \n      Han Gao, \n      \n      Haijie Dai, \n      \n      Qianli Lei, \n      \n      Chang Liu\"\t2024/11/21\tWe propose a path-tracking Hybrid A* planner and a coupled hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller in scenarios involving the path smoothing of agricultural vehicles. For agricultural vehicles following reference paths on farmlands, especially during cross-furrow operations, a minimum deviation from the reference path is desired, in addition to the curvature constraints and body scale collision avoidance. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We propose the path-tracking Hybrid A*, which satisfies nonholonomic constraints and vehicle size collision avoidance, and devise new cost and heuristic functions to minimize the deviation degree. The path-tracking Hybrid A* can not only function in offline smoothing but also the real-time adjustment when confronted with unexpected obstacles. (2) We propose the hierarchical MPC to safely track the smoothed trajectory, using the initial solution solved by linearized MPC and nonlinear local adjustments around the initial solution. (3) We carry out extensive simulations with baseline comparisons based on real-world farm datasets to evaluate the performance of our algorithm.\nAn Integrated (Crop Model, Cloud and Big Data Analytic) Framework to support Agriculture Activity Monitoring System\t\"Shamim Akhter, \n      \n      Kiyoshi Honda, \n      \n      Kento Aida, \n      \n      Amor V. M. Ines\"\t2024/11/19\tAgriculture activity monitoring needs to deal with large amounts of data originating from various organizations (weather stations, agriculture repositories, field management, farm management, universities, etc.) and mass people. Therefore, a scalable environment with flexible information access, easy communication, and real-time collaboration from all types of computing devices, including mobile handheld devices such as smartphones, PDAs and iPads, Geo-sensor devices, etc. are essential. The system must be accessible, scalable, and transparent from location, migration, and resources. In addition, the framework should support modern information retrieval and management systems, unstructured information to structured information processing, task prioritization, task distribution, workflow and task scheduling systems, processing power, and data storage. Thus, High Scalability Computing (HSC) or Cloud-based systems with Big data analytics can be a prominent and convincing solution for this circumstance. In this paper, we are going to propose an integrated (crop model, cloud, and big data analytics) geo-information framework to support agriculture activity monitoring systems.\nGeophysical contribution to study the spatial variability of agricultural yields\t\"Rami Albasha, \n      \n      Julien Thiesson, \n      \n      Solène Buvat, \n      \n      J. -M Lopez, \n      \n      Bruno Cheviron, \n      \n      Roger Guérin\"\t2024/11/04\tStudies conducted on the experimental site of Lavalette (IRSTEA Montpellier) have shown variability in the observed agricultural yield, either attributable to spatial or temporal heterogeneities in water and nitrogen supply or to gradients of soil properties.

We present a robotic system for autonomous pepper harvesting designed to operate in these unprotected, complex settings. Utilizing a custom handheld shear-gripper, we collected 300 demonstrations to train a visuomotor policy, enabling the system to adapt to varying field conditions and crop diversity. We achieved a success rate of 28.95% with a cycle time of 31.71 seconds, comparable to existing systems tested under more controlled conditions like greenhouses. Our system demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of leveraging imitation learning for automated harvesting in unstructured agricultural environments. This work aims to advance scalable, automated robotic solutions for agriculture in natural settings.\nKisanQRS: A Deep Learning-based Automated Query-Response System for Agricultural Decision-Making\t\"Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman, \n      \n      Devraj Raghuvanshi, \n      \n      Nagendra Kumar\"\t2024/10/26\tDelivering prompt information and guidance to farmers is critical in agricultural decision-making. Farmers helpline centres are heavily reliant on the expertise and availability of call centre agents, leading to inconsistent quality and delayed responses. To this end, this article presents Kisan Query Response System (KisanQRS), a Deep Learning-based robust query-response framework for the agriculture sector. KisanQRS integrates semantic and lexical similarities of farmers queries and employs a rapid threshold-based clustering method. The clustering algorithm is based on a linear search technique to iterate through all queries and organize them into clusters according to their similarity. For query mapping, LSTM is found to be the optimal method. Our proposed answer retrieval method clusters candidate answers for a crop, ranks these answer clusters based on the number of answers in a cluster, and selects the leader of each cluster. The dataset used in our analysis consists of a subset of 34 million call logs from the Kisan Call Centre (KCC), operated under the Government of India. We evaluated the performance of the query mapping module on the data of five major states of India with 3,00,000 samples and the quantifiable outcomes demonstrate that KisanQRS significantly outperforms traditional techniques by achieving 96.58% top F1-score for a state. The answer retrieval module is evaluated on 10,000 samples and it achieves a competitive NDCG score of 96.20%. KisanQRS is useful in enabling farmers to make informed decisions about their farming practices by providing quick and pertinent responses to their queries.\nDynamic Evolutionary Game Analysis of How Fintech in Banking Mitigates Risks in Agricultural Supply Chain Finance\t\"Qiang Wan, \n      \n      Jun Cui\"\t2024/11/12\t\"This paper explores the impact of banking fintech on reducing financial risks in the agricultural supply chain, focusing on the secondary allocation of commercial credit. The study constructs a three-player evolutionary game model involving banks, core enterprises, and SMEs to analyze how fintech innovations, such as big data credit assessment, blockchain, and AI-driven risk evaluation, influence financial risks and access to credit. The findings reveal that banking fintech reduces financing costs and mitigates financial risks by improving transaction reliability, enhancing risk identification, and minimizing information asymmetry. By optimizing cooperation between banks, core enterprises, and SMEs, fintech solutions enhance the stability of the agricultural supply chain, contributing to rural revitalization goals and sustainable agricultural development. The study provides new theoretical insights and practical recommendations for improving agricultural finance systems and reducing financial risks.\n  Keywords: banking fintech, agricultural supply chain, financial risk, commercial credit, SMEs, evolutionary game model, big data, blockchain, AI-driven risk evaluation.\"\nAgricultural Landscape Understanding At Country-Scale\t\"Radhika Dua, \n      \n      Nikita Saxena, \n      \n      Aditi Agarwal, \n      \n      Alex Wilson, \n      \n      Gaurav Singh, \n      \n      Hoang Tran, \n      \n      Ishan Deshpande, \n      \n      Amandeep Kaur, \n      \n      Gaurav Aggarwal, \n      \n      Chandan Nath, \n      \n      Arnab Basu, \n      \n      Vishal Batchu, \n      \n      Sharath Holla, \n      \n      Bindiya Kurle, \n      \n      Olana Missura, \n      \n      Rahul Aggarwal, \n      \n      Shubhika Garg, \n      \n      Nishi Shah, \n      \n      Avneet Singh, \n      \n      Dinesh Tewari, \n      \n      Agata Dondzik, \n      \n      Bharat Adsul, \n      \n      Milind Sohoni, \n      \n      Asim Rama Praveen, \n      \n      Aaryan Dangi\n      , et al.

In this paper we describe a framework to better identify food security hotspots using a combination of remote sensing, deep learning, crop yield modeling, and causal modeling of the food distribution system. While we feel that the methods are adaptable to other regions of the world, we focus our analysis on the wheat breadbasket of northern India, which supplies a large percentage of the world's population. We present a quantitative analysis of deep learning domain adaptation methods for wheat farm identification based on curated remote sensing data from France. We model climate change impacts on crop yields using the existing crop yield modeling tool WOFOST and we identify key drivers of crop simulation error using a longitudinal penalized functional regression. A description of a system dynamics model of the food distribution system in India is also presented, along with results of food insecurity identification based on seeding this model with the predicted crop yields.\nSynthSet: Generative Diffusion Model for Semantic Segmentation in Precision Agriculture\t\"Andrew Heschl, \n      \n      Mauricio Murillo, \n      \n      Keyhan Najafian, \n      \n      Farhad Maleki\"\t2024/11/05\tThis paper introduces a methodology for generating synthetic annotated data to address data scarcity in semantic segmentation tasks within the precision agriculture domain. Utilizing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we propose a dual diffusion model architecture for synthesizing realistic annotated agricultural data, without any human intervention. We employ super-resolution to enhance the phenotypic characteristics of the synthesized images and their coherence with the corresponding generated masks. We showcase the utility of the proposed method for wheat head segmentation. The high quality of synthesized data underscores the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in generating image-mask pairs. Furthermore, models trained on our generated data exhibit promising performance when tested on an external, diverse dataset of real wheat fields. The results show the efficacy of the proposed methodology for addressing data scarcity for semantic segmentation tasks. Moreover, the proposed approach can be readily adapted for various segmentation tasks in precision agriculture and beyond.\nTowards more efficient agricultural practices via transformer-based crop type classification\t\"E.

Exploring the impact of farmers' borrowing behavior on agricultural production technical efficiency holds significant practical value. This paper utilizes data from the 2020 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and applies Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) along with the Tobit model for empirical analysis. The study finds that farmers' borrowing behavior positively influences agricultural production technical efficiency, with this effect being especially pronounced among low-income farmers. Additionally, the paper further examines household characteristics, such as household head age, gender, educational level, and the proportion of women in the family, in relation to agricultural production technical efficiency. The findings provide policy recommendations for optimizing rural financial service systems and enhancing agricultural production technical efficiency.\nBuilding Multi-Agent Copilot towards Autonomous Agricultural Data Management and Analysis\t\"Yu Pan, \n      \n      Jianxin Sun, \n      \n      Hongfeng Yu, \n      \n      Joe Luck, \n      \n      Geng Bai, \n      \n      Nipuna Chamara, \n      \n      Yufeng Ge, \n      \n      Tala Awada\"\t2024/10/31\tCurrent agricultural data management and analysis paradigms are to large extent traditional, in which data collecting, curating, integration, loading, storing, sharing and analyzing still involve too much human effort and know-how. The experts, researchers and the farm operators need to understand the data and the whole process of data management pipeline to make fully use of the data. The essential problem of the traditional paradigm is the lack of a layer of orchestrational intelligence which can understand, organize and coordinate the data processing utilities to maximize data management and analysis outcome. The emerging reasoning and tool mastering abilities of large language models (LLM) make it a potentially good fit to this position, which helps a shift from the traditional user-driven paradigm to AI-driven paradigm. In this paper, we propose and explore the idea of a LLM based copilot for autonomous agricultural data management and analysis. Based on our previously developed platform of Agricultural Data Management and Analytics (ADMA), we build a proof-of-concept multi-agent system called ADMA Copilot, which can understand user's intent, makes plans for data processing pipeline and accomplishes tasks automatically, in which three agents: a LLM based controller, an input formatter and an output formatter collaborate together. Different from existing LLM based solutions, by defining a meta-program graph, our work decouples control flow and data flow to enhance the predictability of the behaviour of the agents. Experiments demonstrates the intelligence, autonomy, efficacy, efficiency, extensibility, flexibility and privacy of our system. Comparison is also made between ours and existing systems to show the superiority and potential of our system.\nConsumer Segmentation and Participation Drivers in Community-Supported Agriculture: A Choice Experiment and PLS-SEM Approach\t\"Sota Takagi, \n      \n      Miki Saijo, \n      \n      Takumi Ohashi\"\t2025/02/14\tAs the global food system faces increasing challenges from sustainability, climate change, and food security issues, alternative food networks like Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) play an essential role in fostering stronger connections between consumers and producers. However, understanding consumer engagement with CSA is fragmented, particularly in Japan where CSA participation is still emerging. This study aims to identify potential CSA participants in Japan and validate existing theories on CSA participation through a quantitative analysis of 2,484 Japanese consumers. Using choice experiments, Latent Class Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, we identified five distinct consumer segments. The \"Sustainable Food Seekers\" group showed the highest positive utility for CSA, driven primarily by \"Food Education and Learning Opportunities\" and \"Contribution to Environmental and Social Issues.\" These factors were consistently significant across all segments, suggesting that many Japanese consumers value CSA for its educational and environmental benefits. In contrast, factors related to \"Variety of Ingredients\" were less influential in determining participation intentions. The findings suggest that promoting CSA in Japan may be most effective by emphasizing its role in environmental and social impact, rather than focusing solely on product attributes like organic certification, which is readily available in supermarkets. This reflects a key distinction between CSA adoption in Japan and in other cultural contexts, where access to organic produce is a primary driver. For \"Sustainable Food Seekers,\" CSA offers a way to contribute to broader societal goals rather than just securing organic products.\nHarvestTech agriculture cooperatives: Beneficiaries and compensations\t\"Anjeza Bekolli, \n      \n      Luis A.

This paper aims to adapt to specific fields at low cost using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). We explore a novel domain shift from a diverse, large pool of internet-sourced data to a small set of data collected by a robot at specific locations, minimizing the need for extensive on-field data collection. Additionally, we introduce a novel module -- the Multi-level Attention-based Adversarial Discriminator (MAAD) -- which can be integrated at the feature extractor level of any detection model. In this study, we incorporate MAAD with CenterNet to simultaneously detect leaf, stem, and vein instances. Our results show significant performance improvements in the unlabeled target domain compared to baseline models, with a 7.5% increase in object detection accuracy and a 5.1% improvement in keypoint detection.\nThe unrealized potential of agroforestry for an emissions-intensive agricultural commodity\t\"Alexander Becker, \n      \n      Jan D.

Blaser-Hart\"\t2024/10/28\tReconciling agricultural production with climate-change mitigation and adaptation is one of the most formidable problems in sustainability. One proposed strategy for addressing this problem is the judicious retention of trees in agricultural systems. However, the magnitude of the current and future-potential benefit that trees contribute remains uncertain, particularly in the agricultural sector where trees can also limit production. Here we help to resolve these issues across a West African region responsible for producing ≈\\approx60% of the world's cocoa, a crop that contributes one of the highest per unit carbon footprints of all foods. We use machine learning to generate spatially-explicit estimates of shade-tree cover and carbon stocks across the region. We find that existing shade-tree cover is low, and not spatially aligned with climate threat. But we also find enormous unrealized potential for the sector to counterbalance a large proportion of their high carbon footprint annually, without threatening production. Our methods can be applied to other globally significant commodities that can be grown in agroforests, and align with accounting requirements of carbon markets, and emerging legislative requirements for sustainability reporting.\nDemocratising Agricultural Commodity Price Forecasting: The AGRICAF Approach\tRotem Zelingher\t2025/03/02\tEnsuring food security is a critical global challenge, particularly for low-income countries where food prices impact the access to nutritious food. The volatility of global agricultural commodity (AC) prices exacerbates food insecurity, with international trade restrictions and market disruptions further complicating the situation. Despite online platforms for monitoring food prices, there is a significant gap in providing detailed explanations and forecasts accessible to non-specialists. To address this, we propose the Agricultural Commodity Analysis and Forecasts (AGRICAF) methodology, integrating explainable machine learning (XML) and econometric techniques to analyse and forecast global agricultural commodity prices up to one year ahead, dynamically adapting to different forecast horizons. This innovative integration allows us to model complex interactions and dynamics while providing clear, interpretable results. This paper demonstrates how AGRICAF can be used, applying it to three major agricultural commodities - maize, soybean, and wheat - and explaining how different factors impact prices across various months and forecast horizons. By facilitating access to accurate and interpretable medium-term forecasts of AC prices, AGRICAF can contribute to developing a fair and sustainable food system.\nThreshold-Based Automated Pest Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture\t\"Tianle Li, \n      \n      Jia Shu, \n      \n      Qinghong Chen, \n      \n      Murad Mehrab Abrar, \n      \n      John Raiti\"\t2024/10/17\tThis paper presents a threshold-based automated pea weevil detection system, developed as part of the Microsoft FarmVibes project. Based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and computer vision, the system is designed to monitor and manage pea weevil populations in agricultural settings, with the goal of enhancing crop production and promoting sustainable farming practices. Unlike the machine learning-based approaches, our detection approach relies on binary grayscale thresholding and contour detection techniques determined by the pea weevil sizes. We detail the design of the product, the system architecture, the integration of hardware and software components, and the overall technology strategy.

Despite their ecological importance, optimizing these networks for precision agriculture, forestry,and carbon sequestration remains an open challenge, particularly when it comes to understanding the complex molecular and quantum-scale processes that govern nutrient exchange. In this paper, we propose a novel experimental framework using mycoponics, a controlled, soil-less environment for the study of plant fungal symbiosis integrated with isotopic labeling and quantum dots to track real-time nutrient transfer.\nRAFA-Net: Region Attention Network For Food Items And Agricultural Stress Recognition\t\"Asish Bera, \n      \n      Ondrej Krejcar, \n      \n      Debotosh Bhattacharjee\"\t2024/10/16\tDeep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have facilitated remarkable success in recognizing various food items and agricultural stress. A decent performance boost has been witnessed in solving the agro-food challenges by mining and analyzing of region-based partial feature descriptors. Also, computationally expensive ensemble learning schemes using multiple CNNs have been studied in earlier works. This work proposes a region attention scheme for modelling long-range dependencies by building a correlation among different regions within an input image. The attention method enhances feature representation by learning the usefulness of context information from complementary regions. Spatial pyramidal pooling and average pooling pair aggregate partial descriptors into a holistic representation. Both pooling methods establish spatial and channel-wise relationships without incurring extra parameters. A context gating scheme is applied to refine the descriptiveness of weighted attentional features, which is relevant for classification. The proposed Region Attention network for Food items and Agricultural stress recognition method, dubbed RAFA-Net, has been experimented on three public food datasets, and has achieved state-of-the-art performances with distinct margins. The highest top-1 accuracies of RAFA-Net are 91.69%, 91.56%, and 96.97% on the UECFood-100, UECFood-256, and MAFood-121 datasets, respectively. In addition, better accuracies have been achieved on two benchmark agricultural stress datasets. The best top-1 accuracies on the Insect Pest (IP-102) and PlantDoc-27 plant disease datasets are 92.36%, and 85.54%, respectively; implying RAFA-Net's generalization capability.\nAgroGPT: Efficient Agricultural Vision-Language Model with Expert Tuning\t\"Muhammad Awais, \n      \n      Ali Husain Salem Abdulla Alharthi, \n      \n      Amandeep Kumar, \n      \n      Hisham Cholakkal, \n      \n      Rao Muhammad Anwer\"\t2025/01/09\tSignificant progress has been made in advancing large multimodal conversational models (LMMs), capitalizing on vast repositories of image-text data available online. Despite this progress, these models often encounter substantial domain gaps, hindering their ability to engage in complex conversations across new domains. Recent efforts have aimed to mitigate this issue, albeit relying on domain-specific image-text data to curate instruction-tuning data. However, many domains, such as agriculture, lack such vision-language data. In this work, we propose an approach to construct instruction-tuning data that harnesses vision-only data for the agriculture domain. We utilize diverse agricultural datasets spanning multiple domains, curate class-specific information, and employ large language models (LLMs) to construct an expert-tuning set, resulting in a 70k expert-tuning dataset called AgroInstruct. Subsequently, we expert-tuned and created AgroGPT, an efficient LMM that can hold complex agriculture-related conversations and provide useful insights. We also develop AgroEvals for evaluation and compare {AgroGPT's} performance with large open and closed-source models. {AgroGPT} excels at identifying fine-grained agricultural concepts, can act as an agriculture expert, and provides helpful information for multimodal agriculture questions.

Cyber-physical system (CPS) platforms tailored to specific agricultural environments have emerged, but the diversity of these environments poses challenges in developing adaptive CPS platforms. This paper explores rapid prototyping methods to address these challenges, focusing on non-destructive techniques for estimating plant growth. We present a CPS prototype that combines sensors, microcontrollers, digital image processing, and predictive modeling to measure leaf area and biomass accumulation in hydroponic environments. Our results show that the prototype effectively monitors and predicts plant growth, highlighting the potential of rapid CPS prototyping in promoting sustainability and improving crop yields at a moderate cost of hardware.\nCollision-Aware Traversability Analysis for Autonomous Vehicles in the Context of Agricultural Robotics\t\"Florian Philippe, \n      \n      Johann Laconte, \n      \n      Pierre-Jean Lapray, \n      \n      Matthias Spisser, \n      \n      Jean-Philippe Lauffenburger\"\t2025/03/11\tIn this paper, we introduce a novel method for safe navigation in agricultural robotics. As global environmental challenges intensify, robotics offers a powerful solution to reduce chemical usage while meeting the increasing demands for food production. However, significant challenges remain in ensuring the autonomy and resilience of robots operating in unstructured agricultural environments. Obstacles such as crops and tall grass, which are deformable, must be identified as safely traversable, compared to rigid obstacles. To address this, we propose a new traversability analysis method based on a 3D spectral map reconstructed using a LIDAR and a multispectral camera. This approach enables the robot to distinguish between safe and unsafe collisions with deformable obstacles. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of multispectral metrics for vegetation detection and incorporate these metrics into an augmented environmental map. Utilizing this map, we compute a physics-based traversability metric that accounts for the robot's weight and size, ensuring safe navigation over deformable obstacles.\nAgriCLIP: Adapting CLIP for Agriculture and Livestock via Domain-Specialized Cross-Model Alignment\t\"Umair Nawaz, \n      \n      Muhammad Awais, \n      \n      Hanan Gani, \n      \n      Muzammal Naseer, \n      \n      Fahad Khan, \n      \n      Salman Khan, \n      \n      Rao Muhammad Anwer\"\t2024/10/02\tCapitalizing on vast amount of image-text data, large-scale vision-language pre-training has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities and has been utilized in several applications. However, models trained on general everyday web-crawled data often exhibit sub-optimal performance for specialized domains, likely due to domain shift. Recent works have tackled this problem for some domains (e.g., healthcare) by constructing domain-specialized image-text data. However, constructing a dedicated large-scale image-text dataset for sustainable area of agriculture and livestock is still open to research. Further, this domain desires fine-grained feature learning due to the subtle nature of the downstream tasks (e.g, nutrient deficiency detection, livestock breed classification). To address this we present AgriCLIP, a vision-language foundational model dedicated to the domain of agriculture and livestock. First, we propose a large-scale dataset, named ALive, that leverages customized prompt generation strategy to overcome the scarcity of expert annotations. Our ALive dataset covers crops, livestock, and fishery, with around 600,000 image-text pairs. Second, we propose a training pipeline that integrates both contrastive and self-supervised learning to learn both global semantic and local fine-grained domain-specialized features. Experiments on diverse set of 20 downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of AgriCLIP framework, achieving an absolute gain of 7.8\\% in terms of average zero-shot classification accuracy, over the standard CLIP adaptation via domain-specialized ALive dataset. Our ALive dataset and code can be accessible at \\href{https://github.com/umair1221/AgriCLIP/tree/main}{Github}.\nHyperspectral Unmixing of Agricultural Images taken from UAV Using Adapted U-Net Architecture\t\"Vytautas Paura, \n      \n      Virginijus Marcinkevičius\"\t2024/09/29\tThe hyperspectral unmixing method is an algorithm that extracts material (usually called endmember) data from hyperspectral data cube pixels along with their abundances.

We also propose a hyperspectral unmixing algorithm based on U-Net network architecture to achieve more accurate unmixing results on existing and newly created hyperspectral unmixing datasets.\nSave the Farms: Nonlinear Impact of Climate Change on Banks' Agricultural Lending\tTeng Liu\t2024/09/28\tThe agricultural sector is particularly susceptible to the impact of climate change.

In this paper, I investigate how vulnerability to climate change affects U.S. farms' credit access, and demonstrates that such impact is unequally distributed across farms. I first construct a theoretical framework of bank lending to farms faced with climate risks, and the model helps discipline ensuing empirical analyses that use novel panel datasets at county and at bank levels. I find that higher exposure to climate change, measured by temperature anomaly, reduces bank lending to farms. Such impact is persistent, nonlinear, and heterogeneous. Small and medium farms almost always experience loss of loan access. In comparison, large farms see less severe credit contraction, and in some cases may even see improvement in funding. While small banks carry the burden of continuing to lend to small farms, their limited market share cannot compensate for the reduction of lending from medium and large banks. These results suggest that factors such as farm size and bank type can amplify the financial impact of climate change.\nEstimating The Carbon Footprint Of Digital Agriculture Deployment: A Parametric Bottom-Up Modelling Approach\t\"Pierre La Rocca, \n      \n      Gaël Guennebaud, \n      \n      Aurélie Bugeau, \n      \n      Anne-Laure Ligozat\"\t2024/09/26\tDigitalization appears as a lever to enhance agriculture sustainability. However, existing works on digital agriculture's own sustainability remain scarce, disregarding the environmental effects of deploying digital devices on a large-scale. We propose a bottom-up method to estimate the carbon footprint of digital agriculture scenarios considering deployment of devices over a diversity of farm sizes. It is applied to two use-cases and demonstrates that digital agriculture encompasses a diversity of devices with heterogeneous carbon footprints and that more complex devices yield higher footprints not always compensated by better performances or scaling gains. By emphasizing the necessity of considering the multiplicity of devices, and the territorial distribution of farm sizes when modelling digital agriculture deployments, this study highlights the need for further exploration of the first-order effects of digital technologies in agriculture.\nSparsity, Regularization and Causality in Agricultural Yield: The Case of Paddy Rice in Peru\t\"Rita Rocio Guzman-Lopez, \n      \n      Luis Huamanchumo, \n      \n      Kevin Fernandez, \n      \n      Oscar Cutipa-Luque, \n      \n      Yhon Tiahuallpa, \n      \n      Helder Rojas\"\t2024/09/25\tThis study introduces a novel approach that integrates agricultural census data with remotely sensed time series to develop precise predictive models for paddy rice yield across various regions of Peru. By utilizing sparse regression and Elastic-Net regularization techniques, the study identifies causal relationships between key remotely sensed variables-such as NDVI, precipitation, and temperature-and agricultural yield. To further enhance prediction accuracy, the first- and second-order dynamic transformations (velocity and acceleration) of these variables are applied, capturing non-linear patterns and delayed effects on yield. The findings highlight the improved predictive performance when combining regularization techniques with climatic and geospatial variables, enabling more precise forecasts of yield variability. The results confirm the existence of causal relationships in the Granger sense, emphasizing the value of this methodology for strategic agricultural management. This contributes to more efficient and sustainable production in paddy rice cultivation.\nFields of The World: A Machine Learning Benchmark Dataset For Global Agricultural Field Boundary Segmentation\t\"Hannah Kerner, \n      \n      Snehal Chaudhari, \n      \n      Aninda Ghosh, \n      \n      Caleb Robinson, \n      \n      Adeel Ahmad, \n      \n      Eddie Choi, \n      \n      Nathan Jacobs, \n      \n      Chris Holmes, \n      \n      Matthias Mohr, \n      \n      Rahul Dodhia, \n      \n      Juan M.

Machine learning (ML) methods for automatically extracting field boundaries from remotely sensed images could help realize the demand for these datasets at a global scale. However, current ML methods for field instance segmentation lack sufficient geographic coverage, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. Further, research on improving ML methods is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets representing the diversity of global agricultural fields. We present Fields of The World (FTW) -- a novel ML benchmark dataset for agricultural field instance segmentation spanning 24 countries on four continents (Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America). FTW is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets with 70,462 samples, each containing instance and semantic segmentation masks paired with multi-date, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. We provide results from baseline models for the new FTW benchmark, show that models trained on FTW have better zero-shot and fine-tuning performance in held-out countries than models that aren't pre-trained with diverse datasets, and show positive qualitative zero-shot results of FTW models in a real-world scenario -- running on Sentinel-2 scenes over Ethiopia.\nDeep Learning for Precision Agriculture: Post-Spraying Evaluation and Deposition Estimation\t\"Harry Rogers, \n      \n      Tahmina Zebin, \n      \n      Grzegorz Cielniak, \n      \n      Beatriz De La Iglesia, \n      \n      Ben Magri\"\t2024/09/24\tPrecision spraying evaluation requires automation primarily in post-spraying imagery.

Estimation of coverage rates of spray deposition in a class-wise manner allows for further understanding of effectiveness of precision spraying systems. Our study evaluates different Class Activation Mapping techniques, namely AblationCAM and ScoreCAM, to determine which is more effective and interpretable for these tasks. In the pipeline, inference-only feature fusion is used to allow for further interpretability and to enable the automation of precision spraying evaluation post-spray.

In agricultural settings, NeRFs can serve as digital twins, providing critical information about fruit detection for yield estimation and other important metrics for farmers. However, traditional NeRFs are not robust to challenging lighting conditions, such as low-light, extreme bright light and varying lighting. To address these issues, this work leverages three different sensors: an RGB camera, an event camera and a thermal camera. Our RGB scene reconstruction shows an improvement in PSNR and SSIM by +2.06 dB and +8.3% respectively. Our cross-spectral scene reconstruction enhances downstream fruit detection by +43.0% in mAP50 and +61.1% increase in mAP50-95. The integration of additional sensors leads to a more robust and informative NeRF. We demonstrate that our multi-modal system yields high quality photo-realistic reconstructions under various tree canopy covers and at different times of the day. This work results in the development of a resilient NeRF, capable of performing well in visibly degraded scenarios, as well as a learnt cross-spectral representation, that is used for automated fruit detection.\nShizishanGPT: An Agricultural Large Language Model Integrating Tools and Resources\t\"Shuting Yang, \n      \n      Zehui Liu, \n      \n      Wolfgang Mayer\"\t2024/09/20\tRecent developments in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in intelligent dialogue systems'ability to handle complex inquiries. However, current LLMs still exhibit limitations in specialized domain knowledge, particularly in technical fields such as agriculture. To address this problem, we propose ShizishanGPT, an intelligent question answering system for agriculture based on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and agent architecture. ShizishanGPT consists of five key modules: including a generic GPT-4 based module for answering general questions; a search engine module that compensates for the problem that the large language model's own knowledge cannot be updated in a timely manner; an agricultural knowledge graph module for providing domain facts; a retrieval module which uses RAG to supplement domain knowledge; and an agricultural agent module, which invokes specialized models for crop phenotype prediction, gene expression analysis, and so on. We evaluated the ShizishanGPT using a dataset containing 100 agricultural questions specially designed for this study. The experimental results show that the tool significantly outperforms general LLMs as it provides more accurate and detailed answers due to its modular design and integration of different domain knowledge sources. Our source code, dataset, and model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/Zaiwen/CropGPT.\nEnhancing Agricultural Environment Perception via Active Vision and Zero-Shot Learning\t\"Michele Carlo La Greca, \n      \n      Mirko Usuelli, \n      \n      Matteo Matteucci\"\t2024/09/19\tAgriculture, fundamental for human sustenance, faces unprecedented challenges.

Current practices often lead to the overuse of agronomic inputs, such as synthetic fertilizers and water, resulting in environmental contamination and diminishing returns on crop productivity. The complexity of agricultural systems, involving plant-environment interactions and human management, presents significant scientific and technical challenges for developing sustainable practices. Addressing these challenges necessitates transdisciplinary research, involving intense collaboration among fields such as plant science, engineering, computer science, and social sciences. Here, we present five case studies from two research centers demonstrating successful transdisciplinary approaches toward more sustainable water and fertilizer use. These case studies span multiple scales. Starting from whole-plant signaling, we explore how reporter plants can transform our understanding of plant communication and enable efficient application of water and fertilizers. We then show how new fertilizer technologies could increase the availability of phosphorus in the soil. To accelerate advancements in breeding new cultivars, we discuss robotic technologies for high-throughput plant screening in different environments at a population scale. At the ecosystem scale, we investigate phosphorus recovery from aquatic systems and methods to minimize phosphorus leaching. Finally, as agricultural outputs affect all people, we show how to integrate stakeholder perspectives and needs into the research. With these case studies, we hope to encourage the scientific community to adopt transdisciplinary research and promote cross-training among biologists, engineers, and social scientists to drive discovery and innovation in advancing sustainable agricultural systems.\nAmbient IoT: Communications Enabling Precision Agriculture\t\"Ashwin Natraj Arun, \n      \n      Byunghyun Lee, \n      \n      Fabio A.

However, it raises privacy concerns such as adverse pricing, price discrimination, higher insurance costs, and manipulation of resources, deterring farm operators from sharing data due to potential misuse. This study introduces a privacy-preserving framework that addresses these risks while allowing secure data sharing for digital agriculture. Our framework enables comprehensive data analysis while protecting privacy. It allows stakeholders to harness research-driven policies that link public and private datasets. The proposed algorithm achieves this by: (1) identifying similar farmers based on private datasets, (2) providing aggregate information like time and location, (3) determining trends in price and product availability, and (4) correlating trends with public policy data, such as food insecurity statistics. We validate the framework with real-world Farmer's Market datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through machine learning models trained on linked privacy-preserved data. The results support policymakers and researchers in addressing food insecurity and pricing issues. This work significantly contributes to digital agriculture by providing a secure method for integrating and analyzing data, driving advancements in agricultural technology and development.\nAgGym: An agricultural biotic stress simulation environment for ultra-precision management planning\t\"Mahsa Khosravi, \n      \n      Matthew Carroll, \n      \n      Kai Liang Tan, \n      \n      Liza Van der Laan, \n      \n      Joscif Raigne, \n      \n      Daren S.

Current state-of-the-art field crop management relies on coarse-scale crop management strategies, where entire fields are sprayed with pest and disease-controlling chemicals, leading to increased cost and sub-optimal soil and crop management. To overcome these challenges and optimize crop production, we utilize machine learning tools within a virtual field environment to generate localized management plans for farmers to manage biotic threats while maximizing profits. Specifically, we present AgGym, a modular, crop and stress agnostic simulation framework to model the spread of biotic stresses in a field and estimate yield losses with and without chemical treatments.

Visual navigation and local mapping have shown a relatively good performance in open-field environments. However, globally consistent mapping and long-term localization still depend on the robustness of loop detection and closure, for which the literature is scarce. In this work we propose a novel method to pave the way towards robust loop detection in open fields, particularly in agricultural settings, based on local feature search and stereo geometric refinement, with a final stage of relative pose estimation. Our method consistently achieves good loop detections, with a median error of 15cm. We aim to characterize open fields as a novel environment for loop detection, understanding the limitations and problems that arise when dealing with them.\nAgricultural On-Demand Networks for 6G enabled by THz Communication\t\"Daniel Lindenschmitt, \n      \n      Christoph Fischer, \n      \n      Simon Haussmann, \n      \n      Marc Kalter, \n      \n      Ingmar Kallfass, \n      \n      Hans D.

Crucial challenges include establishing robust wireless communication in rural areas, enabling collaboration among agricultural machines, and integrating artificial intelligence into farming practices. Addressing these challenges necessitates a consistent communication system, with wireless communication emerging as a key enabler. Cellular technologies, as 5G and its successor 6G, can offer a comprehensive solution here. Leveraging technologies following the ITU-R M. 2160 recommendation like THz communication, low-latency wireless AI, and embedded sensing, can provide a flexible and energy-efficient infrastructure. This paper introduces on-demand networks based on the OpenRAN approach and a 7.2 functional split. By implementing THz front-hauling between components, a flexible application of 5G or future 6G networks can be realized. Experiments demonstrate that THz communication is suitable for data transmission over the eCPRI interface, particularly in terms of data rate, thereby reducing the need for wired alternatives such as fiber optic cables. Furthermore, limitations such as limited range are discussed, and possible initial solutions are presented. The integration of the OpenRAN standard further enhances flexibility, which is crucial in dynamic agricultural environments. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the transformative potential of 6G-enabled wireless communication in shaping the future of smart agriculture.\nEnhanced Infield Agriculture with Interpretable Machine Learning Approaches for Crop Classification\t\"Sudi Murindanyi, \n      \n      Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende, \n      \n      Rahman Sanya, \n      \n      Rose Nakibuule, \n      \n      Andrew Katumba\"\t2024/08/22\tThe increasing popularity of Artificial Intelligence in recent years has led to a surge in interest in image classification, especially in the agricultural sector. With the help of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, the sector has undergone a significant transformation, leading to the development of new techniques for crop classification in the field. Despite the extensive research on various image classification techniques, most have limitations such as low accuracy, limited use of data, and a lack of reporting model size and prediction. The most significant limitation of all is the need for model explainability. This research evaluates four different approaches for crop classification, namely traditional ML with handcrafted feature extraction methods like SIFT, ORB, and Color Histogram; Custom Designed CNN and established DL architecture like AlexNet; transfer learning on five models pre-trained using ImageNet such as EfficientNetV2, ResNet152V2, Xception, Inception-ResNetV2, MobileNetV3; and cutting-edge foundation models like YOLOv8 and DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer Model. All models performed well, but Xception outperformed all of them in terms of generalization, achieving 98% accuracy on the test data, with a model size of 80.03 MB and a prediction time of 0.0633 seconds. A key aspect of this research was the application of Explainable AI to provide the explainability of all the models. This journal presents the explainability of Xception model with LIME, SHAP, and GradCAM, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in the models' predictions.

The overall TCI dynamics have been mainly dominated by contemporaneous dynamics rather than the lagged dynamics. We also find climate change has significant spillovers to other markets. Moreover, there are heterogeneous spillover effects among agricultural markets. Specially, corn is the biggest risk contributor to this system, while barley is the major risk receiver of shocks.\nLLMs for Enhanced Agricultural Meteorological Recommendations\t\"Ji-jun Park, \n      \n      Soo-joon Choi\"\t2024/07/30\tAgricultural meteorological recommendations are crucial for enhancing crop productivity and sustainability by providing farmers with actionable insights based on weather forecasts, soil conditions, and crop-specific data.

Hormaza, \n      \n      Iñaki Vadillo Pérez, \n      \n      Pablo Jiménez Gavilán\"\t2024/08/01\tSpain is the largest producer of avocado and mango fruits in Europe. The majority of production is concentrated in the Axarquía region in the south, where subtropical fruit plantations and associated water demands have steadily increased over the last two decades. Between 2019-2024, the region underwent an extreme water crisis. Reservoir reserves became nearly depleted and groundwater levels dropped to sea level in several locations, where seawater intrusion is likely, causing large socioeconomic impacts including short-term harvest losses and a long-term loss in economic centrality. We examine the causal pathway that led to this crisis using a mixed-methods approach, combining data from key informant interviews, an exhaustive review of legal documents, and quantitative analysis of time series and spatially explicit data. In particular, we analyze dam water use for irrigation and urban use, meteorological data, reservoir and groundwater levels, and irrigation land cover maps. Our findings show that an unusual meteorological drought was the immediate cause for the decline in reservoir and groundwater reserves (hydrological drought), but the underlying cause was a chronic and structural long-term imbalance between water demand and resources resulting from several structural governance shortcomings: large uncertainties in water resource availability and use hampering effective planning, lack of enforcement of individual water quotas, and the absence of regulatory mechanisms to flexibly impose resource use restrictions at both micro and macro levels based on the overall resources of the system. We propose concrete policy interventions aimed at sustainably enhancing the resilience of the system that can be useful to efficiently manage water shortages in other regions with similar problems.\nSpatial Transformer Network YOLO Model for Agricultural Object Detection\t\"Yash Zambre, \n      \n      Ekdev Rajkitkul, \n      \n      Akshatha Mohan, \n      \n      Joshua Peeples\"\t2024/09/15\tObject detection plays a crucial role in the field of computer vision by autonomously locating and identifying objects of interest.

We propose a new method that integrates spatial transformer networks (STNs) into YOLO to improve performance. The proposed STN-YOLO aims to enhance the model's effectiveness by focusing on important areas of the image and improving the spatial invariance of the model before the detection process. Our proposed method improved object detection performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. We explore the impact of different localization networks within the STN module as well as the robustness of the model across different spatial transformations. We apply the STN-YOLO on benchmark datasets for Agricultural object detection as well as a new dataset from a state-of-the-art plant phenotyping greenhouse facility.

Agriculture is another key factor affecting the lives of people around the world. It provides food, fabric, and coal for humanity. However, facing many challenges such as pests and diseases, soil degradation, global warming, and food security, how to steadily increase the yield in the agricultural sector is a problem that humans still need to solve. Large models can help farmers improve production efficiency and harvest by detecting a series of agricultural production tasks such as pests and diseases, soil quality, and seed quality. It can also help farmers make wise decisions through a variety of information, such as images, text, etc. Herein, we delve into the potential applications of large models in agriculture, from large language model (LLM) and large vision model (LVM) to large vision-language models (LVLM). After gaining a deeper understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLM), it can be recognized that problems such as agricultural image processing, agricultural question answering systems, and agricultural machine automation can all be solved by large models. Large models have great potential in the field of agriculture. We outline the current applications of agricultural large models, and aims to emphasize the importance of large models in the domain of agriculture. In the end, we envisage a future in which famers use MLLM to accomplish many tasks in agriculture, which can greatly improve agricultural production efficiency and yield.\nLeveraging Vision Language Models for Specialized Agricultural Tasks\t\"Muhammad Arbab Arshad, \n      \n      Talukder Zaki Jubery, \n      \n      Tirtho Roy, \n      \n      Rim Nassiri, \n      \n      Asheesh K.

We present AgEval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing VLMs' capabilities in plant stress phenotyping, offering a solution to the challenge of limited annotated data in agriculture. Our study explores how general-purpose VLMs can be leveraged for domain-specific tasks with only a few annotated examples, providing insights into their behavior and adaptability. AgEval encompasses 12 diverse plant stress phenotyping tasks, evaluating zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning performance of state-of-the-art models including Claude, GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA. Our results demonstrate VLMs' rapid adaptability to specialized tasks, with the best-performing model showing an increase in F1 scores from 46.24% to 73.37% in 8-shot identification. To quantify performance disparities across classes, we introduce metrics such as the coefficient of variation (CV), revealing that VLMs' training impacts classes differently, with CV ranging from 26.02% to 58.03%. We also find that strategic example selection enhances model reliability, with exact category examples improving F1 scores by 15.38% on average. AgEval establishes a framework for assessing VLMs in agricultural applications, offering valuable benchmarks for future evaluations. Our findings suggest that VLMs, with minimal few-shot examples, show promise as a viable alternative to traditional specialized models in plant stress phenotyping, while also highlighting areas for further refinement.

Leveraging the multi-scale nature of the costmaps supporting Nav2, we developed a system that using a depth camera performs pixel level classification on the images, and in real time injects corrections into the local cost map, thus enabling the robot to traverse areas that would otherwise be avoided by the Nav2. Our approach has been implemented and validated on a Clearpath Husky and we demonstrate that with this extension the robot is able to perform navigation tasks that would be otherwise not practical with the standard components.\nSpatially-clustered spatial autoregressive models with application to agricultural market concentration in Europe\t\"Roy Cerqueti, \n      \n      Paolo Maranzano, \n      \n      Raffaele Mattera\"\t2024/07/19\tIn this paper, we present an extension of the spatially-clustered linear regression models, namely, the spatially-clustered spatial autoregression (SCSAR) model, to deal with spatial heterogeneity issues in clustering procedures. In particular, we extend classical spatial econometrics models, such as the spatial autoregressive model, the spatial error model, and the spatially-lagged model, by allowing the regression coefficients to be spatially varying according to a cluster-wise structure. Cluster memberships and regression coefficients are jointly estimated through a penalized maximum likelihood algorithm which encourages neighboring units to belong to the same spatial cluster with shared regression coefficients. Motivated by the increase of observed values of the Gini index for the agricultural production in Europe between 2010 and 2020, the proposed methodology is employed to assess the presence of local spatial spillovers on the market concentration index for the European regions in the last decade. Empirical findings support the hypothesis of fragmentation of the European agricultural market, as the regions can be well represented by a clustering structure partitioning the continent into three-groups, roughly approximated by a division among Western, North Central and Southeastern regions. Also, we detect heterogeneous local effects induced by the selected explanatory variables on the regional market concentration. In particular, we find that variables associated with social, territorial and economic relevance of the agricultural sector seem to act differently throughout the spatial dimension, across the clusters and with respect to the pooled model, and temporal dimension.\nOptimizing Agricultural Order Fulfillment Systems: A Hybrid Tree Search Approach\t\"Pranay Thangeda, \n      \n      Hoda Helmi, \n      \n      Melkior Ornik\"\t2024/07/18\tEfficient order fulfillment is vital in the agricultural industry, particularly due to the seasonal nature of seed supply chains. This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing seed orders fulfillment in a centralized warehouse where orders are processed in waves, taking into account the unpredictable arrival of seed stocks and strict order deadlines. We model the wave scheduling problem as a Markov decision process and propose an adaptive hybrid tree search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo tree search with domain-specific knowledge to efficiently navigate the complex, dynamic environment of seed distribution. By leveraging historical data and stochastic modeling, our method enables forecast-informed scheduling decisions that balance immediate requirements with long-term operational efficiency. The key idea is that we can augment Monte Carlo tree search algorithm with problem-specific side information that dynamically reduces the number of candidate actions at each decision step to handle the large state and action spaces that render traditional solution methods computationally intractable. Extensive simulations with realistic parameters-including a diverse range of products, a high volume of orders, and authentic seasonal durations-demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing industry standard methods.\nA Dataset and Benchmark for Shape Completion of Fruits for Agricultural Robotics\t\"Federico Magistri, \n      \n      Thomas Läbe, \n      \n      Elias Marks, \n      \n      Sumanth Nagulavancha, \n      \n      Yue Pan, \n      \n      Claus Smitt, \n      \n      Lasse Klingbeil, \n      \n      Michael Halstead, \n      \n      Heiner Kuhlmann, \n      \n      Chris McCool, \n      \n      Jens Behley, \n      \n      Cyrill Stachniss\"\t2025/03/06\tAs the world population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, our agricultural production system needs to double its productivity despite a decline of human workforce in the agricultural sector. Autonomous robotic systems are one promising pathway to increase productivity by taking over labor-intensive manual tasks like fruit picking. To be effective, such systems need to monitor and interact with plants and fruits precisely, which is challenging due to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments causing, for example, strong occlusions. Thus, being able to estimate the complete 3D shapes of objects in presence of occlusions is crucial for automating operations such as fruit harvesting. In this paper, we propose the first publicly available 3D shape completion dataset for agricultural vision systems. We provide an RGB-D dataset for estimating the 3D shape of fruits. Specifically, our dataset contains RGB-D frames of single sweet peppers in lab conditions but also in a commercial greenhouse. For each fruit, we additionally collected high-precision point clouds that we use as ground truth.

The system integrates an Ultra-compact Soil Moisture Sensor (UCSMS) for precise sensing, along with a Pattern Reconfigurable Antenna (PRA) for efficient transmission of information to the base station. A multiturn complementary spiral resonator (MCSR) is etched onto the ground plane of a microstrip transmission line to achieve miniaturization. The UCSMS operates at 180 MHz with a 3-turn complementary spiral resonator (3-CSR), at 102 MHz with a 4- turn complementary spiral resonator (4-CSR), and at 86 MHz with a 5-turn complementary spiral resonator (5-CSR). Due to its low resonance frequency, the proposed UCSMS is insensitive to variations in the Volume Under Test (VUT) of soil. A probe-fed circular patch antenna is designed in the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) band (2.45 GHz) with a maximum measured gain of 5.63 dBi. Additionally, four varactor diodes are integrated across the slots on the bottom side of the substrate to achieve pattern reconfiguration. Six different radiation patterns have been achieved by using different bias conditions of the diodes. In standby mode, PRA can serve as a means for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) or Energy Harvesting (EH) to store power in a battery. This stored power can then be utilized to bias the varactor diodes. The combination of UCSMS and PRA enables the realization of a joint sensing and communication system. The proposed system's planar and simple geometry, along with its high sensitivity of 2.05 %, makes it suitable for smart agriculture applications. Moreover, the sensor is adaptive and capable of measuring the permittivity of various Material Under Test (MUT) within the range of 1 to 23.\nEquilibrium Strategies of Carbon Emission Reduction in Agricultural Product Supply Chain under Carbon Sink Trading\t\"Tingting Meng, \n      \n      Yukun Cheng, \n      \n      Xujin Pu, \n      \n      Rui Li\"\t2024/07/06\tAs global climate change and environmental issues escalate, carbon reduction has emerged as a paramount global concern. Agriculture accounts for approximately 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making carbon reduction in this sector crucial for attaining global emission targets. Carbon sink trading serves as a supplementary mechanism to achieve carbon peaking and neutrality, helping to lower the rate ofcarbon emissions. However, practical projects and research in the field of carbon sink trading are not enough currently. This work aims to thoroughly explore the cooperative models between farmers and retailers within the context of agricultural carbon sink trading, as well as the optimal decisions on the efforts to reduce carbon emission for both parties under different cooperative models. To this end, we delve into three distinct cooperative frameworks: the decentralized, the Stackelberg, and the centralized models, each accompanied by a corresponding differentialgame model.

Machine vision-based fruit detection has been recognized as a crucial component for robust identification of fruits to guide robotic manipulation. Despite considerable progress in leveraging deep learning and machine learning techniques for fruit detection, a common shortfall is the inability to swiftly extend the developed models across different orchards and/or various fruit species. Additionally, the limited availability of pertinent data further compounds these challenges. In this work, we introduce MetaFruit, the largest publicly available multi-class fruit dataset, comprising 4,248 images and 248,015 manually labeled instances across diverse U.S. orchards. Furthermore, this study proposes an innovative open-set fruit detection system leveraging advanced Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for fruit detection that can adeptly identify a wide array of fruit types under varying orchard conditions. This system not only demonstrates remarkable adaptability in learning from minimal data through few-shot learning but also shows the ability to interpret human instructions for subtle detection tasks. The performance of the developed foundation model is comprehensively evaluated using several metrics, which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in both our MetaFruit dataset and other open-sourced fruit datasets, thereby setting a new benchmark in the field of agricultural technology and robotic harvesting. The MetaFruit dataset and detection framework are open-sourced to foster future research in vision-based fruit harvesting, marking a significant stride toward addressing the urgent needs of the agricultural sector.\nInvestigating the Segment Anything Foundation Model for Mapping Smallholder Agriculture Field Boundaries Without Training Labels\t\"Pratyush Tripathy, \n      \n      Kathy Baylis, \n      \n      Kyle Wu, \n      \n      Jyles Watson, \n      \n      Ruizhe Jiang\"\t2024/07/01\tAccurate mapping of agricultural field boundaries is crucial for enhancing outcomes like precision agriculture, crop monitoring, and yield estimation. However, extracting these boundaries from satellite images is challenging, especially for smallholder farms and data-scarce environments. This study explores the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to delineate agricultural field boundaries in Bihar, India, using 2-meter resolution SkySat imagery without additional training. We evaluate SAM's performance across three model checkpoints, various input sizes, multi-date satellite images, and edge-enhanced imagery. Our results show that SAM correctly identifies about 58% of field boundaries, comparable to other approaches requiring extensive training data. Using different input image sizes improves accuracy, with the most significant improvement observed when using multi-date satellite images. This work establishes proof of concept for using SAM and maximizing its potential in agricultural field boundary mapping. Our work highlights SAM's potential in delineating agriculture field boundary in training-data scarce settings to enable a wide range of agriculture related analysis.\nCo-benefits of Agricultural Diversification and Technology for Food and Nutrition Security in China\t\"Thomas Cherico Wanger, \n      \n      Estelle Raveloaritiana, \n      \n      Siyan Zeng, \n      \n      Haixiu Gao, \n      \n      Xueqing He, \n      \n      Yiwen Shao, \n      \n      Panlong Wu, \n      \n      Kris A.

Sustainable agriculture has been promoted to achieve national food security targets such as food self-sufficiency through the well-facilitated farmland construction (WFFC) approach. The WFFC is introduced in Chinas current national 10-year plan to consolidate farmlands into large and simplified production areas to maximise automation, and improve soil fertility and productivity. However, research suggests that diversified and smaller farms faciliate ecosystem services, can improve yield resilience, defuse human health threats, and increase farm profitability. Currently, WFFC has not considered ecological farmland improvements and it may miss long-term environmental benefits including ecosystem service preservation conducive to yields. Moreover, the nutritional status in China has changed in recent decades with undernutrition being dramatically reduced, but the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and chronic diseases being increased.

To address this issue, agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) is proposed to recharge the aquifer by artificially flooding agricultural lands using surface water. Ag-MAR requires a carefully selected flooding schedule to avoid affecting the oxygen absorption of crop roots. However, current Ag-MAR scheduling does not take into account complex environmental factors such as weather and soil oxygen, resulting in crop damage and insufficient recharging amounts. This paper proposes MARLP, the first end-to-end data-driven control system for Ag-MAR. We first formulate Ag-MAR as an optimization problem. To that end, we analyze four-year in-field datasets, which reveal the multi-periodicity feature of the soil oxygen level trends and the opportunity to use external weather forecasts and flooding proposals as exogenous clues for soil oxygen prediction. Then, we design a two-stage forecasting framework. In the first stage, it extracts both the cross-variate dependency and the periodic patterns from historical data to conduct preliminary forecasting. In the second stage, it uses weather-soil and flooding-soil causality to facilitate an accurate prediction of soil oxygen levels. Finally, we conduct model predictive control (MPC) for Ag-MAR flooding. To address the challenge of large action spaces, we devise a heuristic planning module to reduce the number of flooding proposals to enable the search for optimal solutions. Real-world experiments show that MARLP reduces the oxygen deficit ratio by 86.8% while improving the recharging amount in unit time by 35.8%, compared with the previous four years.\nAgriculture-Vision Challenge 2024 -- The Runner-Up Solution for Agricultural Pattern Recognition via Class Balancing and Model Ensemble\t\"Wang Liu, \n      \n      Zhiyu Wang, \n      \n      Puhong Duan, \n      \n      Xudong Kang, \n      \n      Shutao Li\"\t2024/06/18\tThe Agriculture-Vision Challenge at CVPR 2024 aims at leveraging semantic segmentation models to produce pixel level semantic segmentation labels within regions of interest for multi-modality satellite images. It is one of the most famous and competitive challenges for global researchers to break the boundary between computer vision and agriculture sectors. However, there is a serious class imbalance problem in the agriculture-vision dataset, which hinders the semantic segmentation performance. To solve this problem, firstly, we propose a mosaic data augmentation with a rare class sampling strategy to enrich long-tail class samples. Secondly, we employ an adaptive class weight scheme to suppress the contribution of the common classes while increasing the ones of rare classes. Thirdly, we propose a probability post-process to increase the predicted value of the rare classes. Our methodology achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 0.547 on the test set, securing second place in this challenge.\nYOLOv1 to YOLOv10: A comprehensive review of YOLO variants and their application in the agricultural domain\t\"Mujadded Al Rabbani Alif, \n      \n      Muhammad Hussain\"\t2024/06/14\tThis survey investigates the transformative potential of various YOLO variants, from YOLOv1 to the state-of-the-art YOLOv10, in the context of agricultural advancements.

Ward\"\t2024/06/03\tThe trends and reactions of the general public towards global events can be analyzed using data from social platforms, including Twitter. The number of tweets has been reported to help detect variations in communication traffic within subsets like countries, age groups and industries. Similarly, publicly accessible data and (in particular) data from social media about agricultural issues provide a great opportunity for obtaining instantaneous snapshots of farmer opinions and a method to track changes in opinion through temporal analysis. In this paper we hypothesize that the presence of keywords like precision agriculture, digital agriculture, Internet of Things (IoT), BigData, remote sensing, GPS, etc., in tweets could serve as an indicator of discussions centered around interest in modern farming practices. We extracted relevant tweets using keywords such as IoT, BigData and Geographical Information System (GIS), and then analyzed their geographical origin and frequency of their mention. We analyzed the Twitter data for the period of 1st -11th January 2018 to understand these trends and the factors affecting them. These factors, such as special events, projects, biogeography, etc., were further analyzed using tweet sources and trending hashtags from the database. The regions with the highest interest in the keywords were United States, Egypt, Brazil, Japan and China. A comparison of frequency of keywords revealed IoT as the most tweeted word (77.6%) in the downloaded data. The most used language was English followed by Spanish, Japanese and French. Periodical tweets on IoT from an account handled by IoT project on Twitter and Seminars on IoT in January in Santa Catarina (Brazil) were found to be the underlying factors for the observed trends.\nSPARROW: Smart Precision Agriculture Robot for Ridding of Weeds\t\"Dhanushka Balasingham, \n      \n      Sadeesha Samarathunga, \n      \n      Gayantha Godakanda Arachchige, \n      \n      Anuththara Bandara, \n      \n      Sasini Wellalage, \n      \n      Dinithi Pandithage, \n      \n      Mahaadikara M.

We compare TimeGPT\\texttt{TimeGPT}'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting ψsoilψ_\\mathrm{soil}. Our results demonstrate that TimeGPT\\texttt{TimeGPT} achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical ψsoilψ_\\mathrm{soil} data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.\nPhotorealistic Robotic Simulation using Unreal Engine 5 for Agricultural Applications\t\"Xingjian Li, \n      \n      Lirong Xiang\"\t2024/05/28\tThis work presents a new robotics simulation environment built upon Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) for agricultural image data generation.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent ML applications in agriculture for sustainability and efficiency. Existing reviews mainly focus on narrow subdomains or lack a fusion-driven perspectives. This study provides a combined analysis of ML applications in agriculture, structured around five key objectives: (i) Analyzing ML techniques across pre-harvesting, harvesting, and post-harvesting phases. (ii) Demonstrating how ML can be used with agricultural data and data fusion. (iii) Conducting a bibliometric and statistical analysis to reveal research trends and activity. (iv) Investigating real-world case studies of leading artificial intelligence (AI)-driven agricultural companies that use different types of multisensors and multisource data. (v) Compiling publicly available datasets to support ML model training. Going beyond existing previous reviews, this review focuses on how machine learning (ML) techniques, combined with multi-source data fusion (integrating remote sensing, IoT, and climate analytics), enhance precision agriculture by improving predictive accuracy and decision-making. Case studies and statistical insights illustrate the evolving landscape of AI driven smart farming, while future research directions also discusses challenges associated with data fusion for heterogeneous datasets. This review bridges the gap between AI research and agricultural applications, offering a roadmap for researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers to harness information fusion and ML for advancing precision agriculture.\nEnhancing Pollinator Conservation towards Agriculture 4.0: Monitoring of Bees through Object Recognition\t\"Ajay John Alex, \n      \n      Chloe M.

Toukir Ahmed, \n      \n      Arthur Villordon, \n      \n      Mohammed Kamruzzaman\"\t2024/06/02\tHyperspectral imaging (HSI) has become a key technology for non-invasive quality evaluation in various fields, offering detailed insights through spatial and spectral data. Despite its efficacy, the complexity and high cost of HSI systems have hindered their widespread adoption. This study addressed these challenges by exploring deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction from RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images, particularly for agricultural products. Specifically, different hyperspectral reconstruction algorithms, such as Hyperspectral Convolutional Neural Network - Dense (HSCNN-D), High-Resolution Network (HRNET), and Multi-Scale Transformer Plus Plus (MST++), were compared to assess the dry matter content of sweet potatoes. Among the tested reconstruction methods, HRNET demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest mean relative absolute error (MRAE) of 0.07, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03, and the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 32.28 decibels (dB). Some key features were selected using the genetic algorithm (GA), and their importance was interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were developed using the RGB, reconstructed, and ground truth (GT) data. The visual and spectra quality of these reconstructed methods was compared with GT data, and predicted maps were generated. The results revealed the prospect of deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction as a cost-effective and efficient quality assessment tool for agricultural and biological applications.\nLarge increases in public R&D investment are needed to avoid declines of US agricultural productivity\t\"Ariel Ortiz-Bobea, \n      \n      Robert G.

We estimate the response of US agricultural Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to both R&D investment and weather, and quantify the public R&D spending required to offset the emerging impacts of climate change. We find that offsetting the climate-induced productivity slowdown by 2050 alone requires a sustained public R&D spending growth of 5.2-7.8% per year over 2021-2050. This amounts to an additional 208−208-434B investment over this period. These are substantial requirements comparable to the public R&D spending growth that followed the two World Wars.\nLessons from Deploying CropFollow++: Under-Canopy Agricultural Navigation with Keypoints\t\"Arun N.

Autonomous under-canopy navigation is challenging due to the tight spacing between the crop rows (∼0.75\\sim 0.75 m), degradation in RTK-GPS accuracy due to multipath error, and noise in LiDAR measurements from the excessive clutter. Our system, CropFollow++, introduces modular and interpretable perception architecture with a learned semantic keypoint representation. We deployed CropFollow++ in multiple under-canopy cover crop planting robots on a large scale (25 km in total) in various field conditions and we discuss the key lessons learned from this.\nOptimizing Energy Efficiency of 5G RedCap Beam Management for Smart Agriculture Applications\t\"Manishika Rawat, \n      \n      Matteo Pagin, \n      \n      Marco Giordani, \n      \n      Louis-Adrien Dufrene, \n      \n      Quentin Lampin, \n      \n      Michele Zorzi\"\t2024/04/24\tBeam management in 5G NR involves the transmission and reception of control signals such as Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), crucial for tasks like initial access and/or channel estimation.

However, stresses show up in different shapes and sizes across different crop types and varieties. Hence, this is posed as an anomaly detection task in agricultural images. Accurate anomaly detection in agricultural UAV images is vital for early identification of field irregularities. Traditional supervised learning faces challenges in adapting to diverse anomalies, necessitating extensive annotated data. In this work, we overcome this limitation with self-supervised learning using a masked image modeling approach. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) extract meaningful normal features from unlabeled image samples which produces high reconstruction error for the abnormal pixels during reconstruction. To remove the need of using only ``normal\" data while training, we use an anomaly suppression loss mechanism that effectively minimizes the reconstruction of anomalous pixels and allows the model to learn anomalous areas without explicitly separating ``normal\" images for training. Evaluation on the Agriculture-Vision data challenge shows a mIOU score improvement in comparison to prior state of the art in unsupervised and self-supervised methods. A single model generalizes across all the anomaly categories in the Agri-Vision Challenge Dataset\nSustainable and Precision Agriculture with the Internet of Everything (IoE)\t\"Adil Z. Babar, \n      \n      Ozgur B. Akan\"\t2025/01/26\tAgriculture faces critical challenges from population growth, resource scarcity, and climate change, driving a shift toward advanced, technology-integrated farming. Mechanization has transformed agriculture, enhancing sustainability and crop productivity. Now, technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, biotechnology, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are advancing precision agriculture. The concept of the Internet of Everything (IoE) has gained traction due to its holistic approach to integrating various IoT specializations, called IoXs with X referring to a specific domain. This paper explores the transformative role of IoE in agriculture, expanding beyond traditional IoT applications to integrate niche subdomains like molecular communication (MC), the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), designer phages, and the Internet of Fungus (IoF). Our study provides a detailed review of how these IoE subdomains, in conjunction with 6G, blockchain, and machine learning (ML), can enhance precision farming in areas like crop monitoring, resource management, and disease control. Unlike prior IoT centric reviews, this work uniquely focuses on IoEs potential to advance agriculture at molecular and biological scales, achieving more precise resource utilization and resilience. Key contributions include an exploration of these technologies applicability, associated challenges, and recommendations for future research directions within precision agriculture.\nActive learning for efficient annotation in precision agriculture: a use-case on crop-weed semantic segmentation\t\"Bart M. van Marrewijk, \n      \n      Charbel Dandjinou, \n      \n      Dan Jeric Arcega Rustia, \n      \n      Nicolas Franco Gonzalez, \n      \n      Boubacar Diallo, \n      \n      Jérôme Dias, \n      \n      Paul Melki, \n      \n      Pieter M. Blok\"\t2024/04/03\tOptimizing deep learning models requires large amounts of annotated images, a process that is both time-intensive and costly. Especially for semantic segmentation models in which every pixel must be annotated. A potential strategy to mitigate annotation effort is active learning. Active learning facilitates the identification and selection of the most informative images from a large unlabelled pool. The underlying premise is that these selected images can improve the model's performance faster than random selection to reduce annotation effort. While active learning has demonstrated promising results on benchmark datasets like Cityscapes, its performance in the agricultural domain remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this research gap by conducting a comparative study of three active learning-based acquisition functions: Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD), stochastic-based BALD (PowerBALD), and Random. The acquisition functions were tested on two agricultural datasets: Sugarbeet and Corn-Weed, both containing three semantic classes: background, crop and weed. Our results indicated that active learning, especially PowerBALD, yields a higher performance than Random sampling on both datasets. But due to the relatively large standard deviations, the differences observed were minimal; this was partly caused by high image redundancy and imbalanced classes. Specifically, more than 89\\% of the pixels belonged to the background class on both datasets.

Except for Wolof, which benefits from some language data for natural language processing, national languages of Senegal are largely ignored by language technology providers. However, such technologies are keys to the protection, promotion and teaching of these languages. Kallaama focuses on the 3 main spoken languages by Senegalese people: Wolof, Pulaar and Sereer. These languages are widely spoken by the population, with around 10 million of native Senegalese speakers, not to mention those outside the country. However, they remain under-resourced in terms of machine-readable data that can be used for automatic processing and language technologies, all the more so in the agricultural sector. We release a transcribed speech dataset containing 125 hours of recordings, about agriculture, in each of the above-mentioned languages. These resources are specifically designed for Automatic Speech Recognition purpose, including traditional approaches. To build such technologies, we provide textual corpora in Wolof and Pulaar, and a pronunciation lexicon containing 49,132 entries from the Wolof dataset.\nThe impact of geopolitical risk on the international agricultural market: Empirical analysis based on the GJR-GARCH-MIDAS model\t\"Yun-Shi Dai, \n      \n      Peng-Fei Dai, \n      \n      Wei-Xing Zhou\"\t2024/04/02\tThe current international landscape is turbulent and unstable, with frequent outbreaks of geopolitical conflicts worldwide. Geopolitical risk has emerged as a significant threat to regional and global peace, stability, and economic prosperity, causing serious disruptions to the global food system and food security. Focusing on the international food market, this paper builds different dimensions of geopolitical risk measures based on the random matrix theory and constructs single- and two-factor GJR-GARCH-MIDAS models with fixed time span and rolling window, respectively, to investigate the impact of geopolitical risk on food market volatility. The findings indicate that modeling based on rolling window performs better in describing the overall volatility of the wheat, maize, soybean, and rice markets, and the two-factor models generally exhibit stronger explanatory power in most cases. In terms of short-term fluctuations, all four staple food markets demonstrate obvious volatility clustering and high volatility persistence, without significant asymmetry. Regarding long-term volatility, the realized volatility of wheat, maize, and soybean significantly exacerbates their long-run market volatility. Additionally, geopolitical risks of different dimensions show varying directions and degrees of effects in explaining the long-term market volatility of the four staple food commodities. This study contributes to the understanding of the macro-drivers of food market fluctuations, provides useful information for investment using agricultural futures, and offers valuable insights into maintaining the stable operation of food markets and safeguarding global food security.\nGenerating Diverse Agricultural Data for Vision-Based Farming Applications\t\"Mikolaj Cieslak, \n      \n      Umabharathi Govindarajan, \n      \n      Alejandro Garcia, \n      \n      Anuradha Chandrashekar, \n      \n      Torsten Hädrich, \n      \n      Aleksander Mendoza-Drosik, \n      \n      Dominik L.

Our dataset includes 12,000 images with semantic labels, offering a comprehensive resource for computer vision tasks in precision agriculture, such as semantic segmentation for autonomous weed control. We validate our model's effectiveness by comparing the synthetic data against real agricultural images, demonstrating its potential to significantly augment training data for machine learning models in agriculture. This approach not only provides a cost-effective solution for generating high-quality, diverse data but also addresses specific needs in agricultural vision tasks that are not fully covered by general-purpose models.\nDODA: Adapting Object Detectors to Dynamic Agricultural Environments in Real-Time with Diffusion\t\"Shuai Xiang, \n      \n      Pieter M.

Deep learning has empowered agriculture vision to analyze vast, complex visual data, but heavily rely on the availability of large annotated datasets. This remains a bottleneck as manual labeling is error-prone, time-consuming, and expensive. The lack of efficient labeling approaches inspired us to consider self-supervised learning as a paradigm shift, learning meaningful feature representations from raw agricultural image data. In this work, we explore how self-supervised representation learning unlocks the potential applicability to diverse agriculture vision tasks by eliminating the need for large-scale annotated datasets. We propose a lightweight framework utilizing SimCLR, a contrastive learning approach, to pre-train a ResNet-50 backbone on a large, unannotated dataset of real-world agriculture field images. Our experimental analysis and results indicate that the model learns robust features applicable to a broad range of downstream agriculture tasks discussed in the paper. Additionally, the reduced reliance on annotated data makes our approach more cost-effective and accessible, paving the way for broader adoption of computer vision in agriculture.\nMulti-objective Optimization for Data Collection in UAV-assisted Agricultural IoT\t\"Lingling Liu, \n      \n      Aimin Wang, \n      \n      Geng Sun, \n      \n      Jiahui Li, \n      \n      Hongyang Pan, \n      \n      Tony Q. S. Quek\"\t2024/03/03\tThe ground fixed base stations (BSs) are often deployed inflexibly, and have high overheads, as well as are susceptible to the damage from natural disasters, making it impractical for them to continuously collect data from sensor devices. To improve the network coverage and performance of wireless communication, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been introduced in diverse wireless networks, therefore in this work we consider employing a UAV as an aerial BS to acquire data of agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To this end, we first formulate a UAV-assisted data collection multi-objective optimization problem (UDCMOP) to efficiently collect the data from agricultural sensing devices. Specifically, we aim to collaboratively optimize the hovering positions of UAV, visit sequence of UAV, speed of UAV, in addition to the transmit power of devices, to simultaneously achieve the maximization of minimum transmit rate of devices, the minimization of total energy consumption of devices, and the minimization of total energy consumption of UAV. Second, the proposed UDCMOP is a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem, which indicates that it includes continuous and discrete solutions, making it intractable to be solved. Therefore, we solve it by proposing an improved multi-objective artificial hummingbird algorithm (IMOAHA) with several specific improvement factors, that are the hybrid initialization operator, Cauchy mutation foraging operator, in addition to the discrete mutation operator. Finally, simulations are carried out to testify that the proposed IMOAHA can effectively improve the system performance comparing to other benchmarks.\nBangladesh Agricultural Knowledge Graph: Enabling Semantic Integration and Data-driven Analysis--Full Version\t\"Rudra Pratap Deb Nath, \n      \n      Tithi Rani Das, \n      \n      Tonmoy Chandro Das, \n      \n      S.

To enhance the sustainability and resilience of the agriculture industry through data-driven insights, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and other organizations consistently collect and publish agricultural data on the Web. Nevertheless, the current datasets encounter various challenges: 1) they are presented in an unsustainable, static, read-only, and aggregated format, 2) they do not conform to the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles, and 3) they do not facilitate interactive analysis and integration with other data sources.

We aimed to prove the feasibility by evaluating the content of the pest management advice generated by LLMs, including the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series from OpenAI and the FLAN series from Google. Considering the context-specific properties of agricultural advice, automatically measuring or quantifying the quality of text generated by LLMs becomes a significant challenge. We proposed an innovative approach, using GPT-4 as an evaluator, to score the generated content on Coherence, Logical Consistency, Fluency, Relevance, Comprehensibility, and Exhaustiveness. Additionally, we integrated an expert system based on crop threshold data as a baseline to obtain scores for Factual Accuracy on whether pests found in crop fields should take management action. Each model's score was weighted by percentage to obtain a final score. The results showed that GPT-3.4 and GPT-4 outperform the FLAN models in most evaluation categories. Furthermore, the use of instruction-based prompting containing domain-specific knowledge proved the feasibility of LLMs as an effective tool in agriculture, with an accuracy rate of 72%, demonstrating LLMs' effectiveness in providing pest management suggestions.\neKichabi v2: Designing and Scaling a Dual-Platform Agricultural Technology in Rural Tanzania\t\"Ananditha Raghunath, \n      \n      Alexander Metzger, \n      \n      Hans Easton, \n      \n      XunMei Liu, \n      \n      Fanchong Wang, \n      \n      Yunqi Wang, \n      \n      Yunwei Zhao, \n      \n      Hosea Mpogole, \n      \n      Richard Anderson\"\t2024/03/14\tAlthough farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa are accessing feature phones and smartphones at historically high rates, they face challenges finding a robust network of agricultural contacts. With collaborators, we conduct a quantitative survey of 1014 agricultural households in Kagera, Tanzania to characterize technology access, use, and comfort levels in the region. Recognizing the paucity of research on dual-platform technologies that cater to both feature phone and smartphone users, we develop and deploy eKichabi v2, a searchable directory of 9833 agriculture-related enterprises accessible via a USSD application and an Android application. To bridge the gap in affordances between the two applications, we conduct a mixed methods pilot leveraging mobile money agents as intermediators for our USSD application's users. Through our investigations, we identify the advantages, obstacles, and critical considerations in the design, implementation, and scalability of agricultural information systems tailored to both feature phone and smartphone users in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nPrecision Agriculture: Crop Mapping using Machine Learning and Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery\t\"Kui Zhao, \n      \n      Siyang Wu, \n      \n      Chang Liu, \n      \n      Yue Wu, \n      \n      Natalia Efremova\"\t2023/11/25\tFood security has grown in significance due to the changing climate and its warming effects. To support the rising demand for agricultural products and to minimize the negative impact of climate change and mass cultivation, precision agriculture has become increasingly important for crop cultivation. This study employs deep learning and pixel-based machine learning methods to accurately segment lavender fields for precision agriculture, utilizing various spectral band combinations extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our fine-tuned final model, a U-Net architecture, can achieve a Dice coefficient of 0.8324.

While aggregation of many small flexible loads such as individual households can help reaching this target, increasing the participation of industries that are major electricity consumers is certainly a way forward. The indoor agriculture sector currently experiences a significant growth to partake in the sustainable production of high-quality food world-wide. As energy-related costs, up to 40\\% of the total expenses, may preclude full maturity of this industry, DR participation can result in a win-win situation. Indeed, the agriculture system must transform and become a sustainable source of food for an increasing number of people worldwide under the constraints of preservation of soils and water, carbon footprint, and energy efficiency. We considered the case of the Russian Federation where indoor farming is burgeoning and already represents a load of several thousand megawatts.

Batarseh\"\t2024/03/12\tThe increasing utilization of emerging technologies in the Food & Agriculture (FA) sector has heightened the need for security to minimize cyber risks. Considering this aspect, this manuscript reviews disclosed and documented cybersecurity incidents in the FA sector. For this purpose, thirty cybersecurity incidents were identified, which took place between July 2011 and April 2023. The details of these incidents are reported from multiple sources such as: the private industry and flash notifications generated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), internal reports from the affected organizations, and available media sources. Considering the available information, a brief description of the security threat, ransom amount, and impact on the organization are discussed for each incident. This review reports an increased frequency of cybersecurity threats to the FA sector. To minimize these cyber risks, popular cybersecurity frameworks and recent agriculture-specific cybersecurity solutions are also discussed. Further, the need for AI assurance in the FA sector is explained, and the Farmer-Centered AI (FCAI) framework is proposed. The main aim of the FCAI framework is to support farmers in decision-making for agricultural production, by incorporating AI assurance. Lastly, the effects of the reported cyber incidents on other critical infrastructures, food security, and the economy are noted, along with specifying the open issues for future development.\nCarbon Economics of Different Agricultural Practices for Farming Soil\t\"Suganthi Pazhanivel Koushika, \n      \n      Anbalagan Krishnaveni, \n      \n      Sellaperumal Pazhanivelan, \n      \n      Alagirisamy Bharani, \n      \n      Venugopal Arunkumar, \n      \n      Perumal Devaki, \n      \n      Narayanan Muthukrishnan\"\t2024/03/12\tThe loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) poses a severe danger to agricultural sustainability around the World. This review examines various farming practices and their impact on soil organic carbon storage. After a careful review of the literature, most of the research indicated that different farming practices, such as organic farming, cover crops, conservation tillage, and agroforestry, play vital roles in increasing the SOC content of the soil sustainably. Root exudation from cover crops increases microbial activity and helps break down complex organic compounds into organic carbon. Conservation tillage enhances the soil structure and maintains carbon storage without disturbing the soil. Agroforestry systems boost organic carbon input and fasten nutrient cycling because the trees and crops have symbiotic relationships. Intercropping and crop rotations have a role in changing the composition of plant residues and promoting carbon storage. There were many understanding on the complex interactions between soil organic carbon dynamics and agricultural practices. Based on the study, the paper reveals, the role of different agricultural practices like Carbon storage through cover crops, crop rotation, mulching Conservation tillage, conventional tillage, zero tillage and organic amendments in organic carbon storage in the soil for maximum crop yield to improve the economic condition of the cultivators.\nDecades matter: Agricultural diversification increases financial profitability, biodiversity, and ecosystem services over time\t\"Estelle Raveloaritiana, \n      \n      Thomas Cherico Wanger\"\t2024/03/07\tSustainable agriculture in the 21st century requires the production of sufficient food while reducing the environmental impact and safeguarding human livelihoods. Many studies have confirmed agricultural diversification practices such as intercropping, organic farming and soil inoculations as a suitable pathway to achieve these goals, but long-term viability of socioeconomic and ecological benefits is uncertain. Here, we quantified the long-term effects of agricultural diversification practices on socioeconomic and ecological benefits based on 50 years of data from 184 meta-analyses and 4,260 effect sizes. We showed that, with neutral crop yield over time, financial profitability, most variables related to biological communities, all aspects of soil quality, and carbon sequestration benefits increased by up to 2823% over 20 years of practice. Non-crop diversification practices and the use of organic amendments increased benefits by up to 2000% after 50 years. A trade-off analysis between yield and other services showed win-win outcomes during the first 25 years. Our synthesis provides the urgently needed evidence for farmers and other decision-makers that diversification increases long-term profitability, biodiversity, and climate mitigation benefits, and therefore, allows upscaling diversification for climate change mitigation and global food system transformation.\nNano/micro-plastics effects in agricultural landscapes: an overlooked threat to pollination, biological pest control, and food security\t\"Dong Sheng, \n      \n      Siyuan Jing, \n      \n      Xueqing He, \n      \n      Alexandra-Maria Klein, \n      \n      Heinz-R.

We synthesized the little-explored effects of NMP on pollinators and biocontrol agents on the organismal, farm and landscape scale. For instance ingested NMP trigger organismal changes from gene expression, organ damage to behavior modifications. At the farm and landscape level, NMP will likely amplify synergistic effects with other threats such as pathogens and antibiotics, and may alter landscape properties such as floral resource distributions in high NMP concentration areas, what we call NMP islands. It is essential to understand the functional exposure pathways of NMP on pollinators and biocontrol agents to comprehensively evaluate the risks for agricultural ecosystems and global food security.\nUncovering the Sino-US dynamic risk spillovers effects: Evidence from agricultural futures markets\t\"Han-Yu Zhu, \n      \n      Peng-Fei Dai, \n      \n      Wei-Xing Zhou\"\t2024/03/04\tAgricultural products play a critical role in human development. With economic globalization and the financialization of agricultural products continuing to advance, the interconnections between different agricultural futures have become closer. We utilize a TVP-VAR-DY model combined with the quantile method to measure the risk spillover between 11 agricultural futures on the futures exchanges of US and China from July 9,2014, to December 31,2022. This study yielded several significant findings. Firstly, CBOT corn, soybean, and wheat were identified as the primary risk transmitters, with DCE corn and soybean as the main risk receivers. Secondly, sudden events or increased economic uncertainty can increase the overall risk spillovers. Thirdly, there is an aggregation of risk spillovers amongst agricultural futures based on the dynamic directional spillover results. Lastly, the central agricultural futures under the conditional mean are CBOT corn and soybean, while CZCE hard wheat and long-grained rice are the two risk spillover centers in extreme cases, as per the results of the spillover network and minimum spanning tree. Based on these results, decision-makers are advised to safeguard against the price risk of agricultural futures under sudden economic events, and investors can utilize the results to construct a superior investment portfolio by taking different agricultural product futures as risk-leading indicators according to various situations.\nHefty: A Modular Reconfigurable Robot for Advancing Robot Manipulation in Agriculture\t\"Dominic Guri, \n      \n      Moonyoung Lee, \n      \n      Oliver Kroemer, \n      \n      George Kantor\"\t2024/02/28\tThis paper presents a modular, reconfigurable robot platform for robot manipulation in agriculture. While robot manipulation promises great advancements in automating challenging, complex tasks that are currently best left to humans, it is also an expensive capital investment for researchers and users because it demands significantly varying robot configurations depending on the task. Modular robots provide a way to obtain multiple configurations and reduce costs by enabling incremental acquisition of only the necessary modules. The robot we present, Hefty, is designed to be modular and reconfigurable. It is designed for both researchers and end-users as a means to improve technology transfer from research to real-world application. This paper provides a detailed design and integration process, outlining the critical design decisions that enable modularity in the mobility of the robot as well as its sensor payload, power systems, computing, and fixture mounting. We demonstrate the utility of the robot by presenting five configurations used in multiple real-world agricultural robotics applications.\nSelection of appropriate multispectral camera exposure settings and radiometric calibration methods for applications in phenotyping and precision agriculture\t\"Vaishali Swaminathan, \n      \n      J. Alex Thomasson, \n      \n      Robert G. Hardin, \n      \n      Nithya Rajan\"\t2024/02/28\tRadiometric accuracy of data is crucial in quantitative precision agriculture, to produce reliable and repeatable data for modeling and decision making. The effect of exposure time and gain settings on the radiometric accuracy of multispectral images was not explored enough. The goal of this study was to determine if having a fixed exposure (FE) time during image acquisition improved radiometric accuracy of images, compared to the default auto-exposure (AE) settings. This involved quantifying the errors from auto-exposure and determining ideal exposure values within which radiometric mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were minimal (< 5%). The results showed that FE orthomosaic was closer to ground-truth (higher R2 and lower MAPE) than AE orthomosaic. An ideal exposure range was determined for capturing canopy and soil objects, without loss of information from under-exposure or saturation from over-exposure. A simulation of errors from AE showed that MAPE < 5% for the blue, green, red, and NIR bands and < 7% for the red edge band for exposure settings within the determined ideal ranges and increased exponentially beyond the ideal exposure upper limit. Further, prediction of total plant nitrogen uptake (g/plant) using vegetation indices (VIs) from two different growing seasons were closer to the ground truth (mostly, R2 > 0.40, and MAPE = 12 to 14%, p < 0.05) when FE was used, compared to the prediction from AE images (mostly, R2 < 0.13, MAPE = 15 to 18%, p >= 0.05).\nChallenging the Black Box: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Attribution Maps of CNN Applications in Agriculture",

The opaque nature of these models, often considered 'black boxes', is addressed through an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art Attribution Maps (AMs), also known as class activation maps (CAMs) or saliency maps. Our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of these AMs uncovers critical practical limitations. Findings reveal that AMs frequently fail to consistently highlight crucial features and often misalign with the features considered important by domain experts. These discrepancies raise substantial questions about the utility of AMs in understanding the decision-making process of neural networks. Our study provides critical insights into the trustworthiness and practicality of AMs within the agriculture and forestry sectors, thus facilitating a better understanding of neural networks in these application areas.\nFrom parcels to people: development of a spatially explicit risk indicator to monitor residential pesticide exposure in agricultural areas\t\"Francesco Galimberti, \n      \n      Stephanie Bopp, \n      \n      Alessandro Carletti, \n      \n      Rui Catarino, \n      \n      Martin Claverie, \n      \n      Pietro Florio, \n      \n      Alessio Ippolito, \n      \n      Arwyn Jones, \n      \n      Flavio Marchetto, \n      \n      Michael Olvedy, \n      \n      Alberto Pistocchi, \n      \n      Astrid Verhegghen, \n      \n      Marijn Van Der Velde, \n      \n      Diana Vieira, \n      \n      Raphael d'Andrimont\"\t2024/02/16\tThe increase in global pesticide use has mirrored the rising demand for food over the last decades, resulting in a boost in crop yields. However, concerns about the impact of pesticides on biodiversity, ecosystems, and human health, especially for populations residing close to cultivated areas, are growing. This study investigates how exposure and possible risks to residents can be estimated at high spatial granularity based on plant protection product data. The complexities of such analysis were explored in France, where relevant data with good granularity are publicly available. Integrating sets of spatial datasets and exposure assessment methodologies, we have developed an indicator to monitor the levels of pesticide risk faced by residents. By spatialising pesticide sales data according to their authorization on specific crops, we developed a detailed map depicting potential pesticide loads at parcel level across France. This spatial distribution served as the basis for an exposure and risk assessment, modelled following the European Food Safety Authority's guidelines. Combining the risk map with population distribution data, we have developed an indicator that allows to monitor patterns in non-dietary exposure to pesticides. Our results show that in France, on average, 13% of people might be exposed to pesticides due to living in the proximity to treated crops. This exposure is in the lower range for 34%, moderate range for 40% and higher range for 25% of the exposed population. The risk evaluation is based on worst case assumptions and values should not be taken as a regulatory risk assessment but as indicator to use, for example, for monitoring time trends. The purpose of this indicator is to demonstrate that more granular pesticide data can improve risk reduction strategies. Harmonized and high-resolution data can help in identifying regions where to focus on sustainable farming.\nIntelligent Agricultural Greenhouse Control System Based on Internet of Things and Machine Learning\t\"Cangqing Wang, \n      \n      Jiangchuan Gong\"\t2025/03/20\tThis study endeavors to conceptualize and execute a sophisticated agricultural greenhouse control system grounded in the amalgamation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. Through meticulous monitoring of intrinsic environmental parameters within the greenhouse and the integration of machine learning algorithms, the conditions within the greenhouse are aptly modulated. The envisaged outcome is an enhancement in crop growth efficiency and yield, accompanied by a reduction in resource wastage. In the backdrop of escalating global population figures and the escalating exigencies of climate change, agriculture confronts unprecedented challenges. Conventional agricultural paradigms have proven inadequate in addressing the imperatives of food safety and production efficiency. Against this backdrop, greenhouse agriculture emerges as a viable solution, proffering a controlled milieu for crop cultivation to augment yields, refine quality, and diminish reliance on natural resources [b1]. Nevertheless, greenhouse agriculture contends with a gamut of challenges. Traditional greenhouse management strategies, often grounded in experiential knowledge and predefined rules, lack targeted personalized regulation, thereby resulting in resource inefficiencies. The exigencies of real-time monitoring and precise control of the greenhouse's internal environment gain paramount importance with the burgeoning scale of agriculture. To redress this challenge, the study introduces IoT technology and machine learning algorithms into greenhouse agriculture, aspiring to institute an intelligent agricultural greenhouse control system conducive to augmenting the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production.\nIntelligent Agricultural Management Considering N2_2O Emission and Climate Variability with Uncertainties\t\"Zhaoan Wang, \n      \n      Shaoping Xiao, \n      \n      Jun Wang, \n      \n      Ashwin Parab, \n      \n      Shivam Patel\"\t2024/02/13\tThis study examines how artificial intelligence (AI), especially Reinforcement Learning (",

Facing climate change and limited agricultural knowledge, we use Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with a crop simulator to model AI agents' interactions with farming environments. We apply deep Q-learning with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based Q networks for training agents on optimal actions. Also, we develop Machine Learning (ML) models to predict N2_2O emissions, integrating these predictions into the simulator. Our research tackles uncertainties in N2_2O emission estimates with a probabilistic ML approach and climate variability through a stochastic weather model, offering a range of emission outcomes to improve forecast reliability and decision-making. By incorporating climate change effects, we enhance agents' climate adaptability, aiming for resilient agricultural practices. Results show these agents can align crop productivity with environmental concerns by penalizing N2_2O emissions, adapting effectively to climate shifts like warmer temperatures and less rain. This strategy improves farm management under climate change, highlighting AI's role in sustainable agriculture.\nValue-based Resource Matching with Fairness Criteria: Application to Agricultural Water Trading\t\"Abhijin Adiga, \n      \n      Yohai Trabelsi, \n      \n      Tanvir Ferdousi, \n      \n      Madhav Marathe, \n      \n      S.

In addressing this problem, many aspects, including the welfare of farmers, the economy, and the environment, must be considered. Under this backdrop, our work focuses on several resource-matching problems accounting for agents with multi-crop portfolios, geographic constraints, and fairness. First, we address a matching problem where the goal is to maximize a welfare function in two-sided markets where buyers' requirements and sellers' supplies are represented by value functions that assign prices (or costs) to specified volumes of water. For the setting where the value functions satisfy certain monotonicity properties, we present an efficient algorithm that maximizes a social welfare function. When there are minimum water requirement constraints, we present a randomized algorithm which ensures that the constraints are satisfied in expectation. For a single seller--multiple buyers setting with fairness constraints, we design an efficient algorithm that maximizes the minimum level of satisfaction of any buyer. We also present computational complexity results that highlight the limits on the generalizability of our results. We evaluate the algorithms developed in our work with experiments on both real-world and synthetic data sets with respect to drought severity, value functions, and seniority of agents.\nModels, methods and algorithms for monitoring environmental impact on agricultural production\t\"Anvar Kabulov, \n      \n      Ibrokhimali Normatov, \n      \n      Islambek Saymanov, \n      \n      Abdusattar Baizhumanov, \n      \n      Inomjon Yarashov\"\t2024/02/13\tThe article analyzes the impact of environmental conditions on agricultural production in the Aral Sea region.

Data innovation is urgently required to secure and improve the productivity, sustainability, and resilience of our agroecosystems. As various sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) instrumentation become more available, affordable, reliable, and stable, it has become possible to conduct data collection, integration, and analysis at multiple temporal and spatial scales, in real-time, and with high resolutions. At the same time, the sheer amount of data poses a great challenge to data storage and analysis, and the \\textit{de facto} data management and analysis practices adopted by scientists have become increasingly inefficient. Additionally, the data generated from different disciplines, such as genomics, phenomics, environment, agronomy, and socioeconomic, can be highly heterogeneous. That is, datasets across disciplines often do not share the same ontology, modality, or format. All of the above make it necessary to design a new data management infrastructure that implements the principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). In this paper, we propose Agriculture Data Management and Analytics (ADMA), which satisfies the FAIR principles. Our new data management infrastructure is intelligent by supporting semantic data management across disciplines, interactive by providing various data management/analysis portals such as web GUI, command line, and API, scalable by utilizing the power of high-performance computing (HPC), extensible by allowing users to load their own data analysis tools, trackable by keeping track of different operations on each file, and open by using a rich set of mature open source technologies.\nSPARC-LoRa: A Scalable, Power-efficient, Affordable, Reliable, and Cloud Service-enabled LoRa Networking System for Agriculture Applications\t\"Xi Wang, \n      \n      Bryan Hatasaka, \n      \n      Zhengyan Liu, \n      \n      Sayali Tope, \n      \n      Mohit Karkhanis, \n      \n      Seungbeom Noh, \n      \n      Farhan Sium, \n      \n      Ravi V.

In this paper, we design and implement a holistic LoRa-based IoT system with LoRa communication capabilities, named SPARC-LoRa, which consists of field sensor nodes and a gateway connected to the Internet. SPARC-LoRa has the following important features. First, the proposed wireless network of SPARC-LoRa is even-driven and using off-the-shelf microcontroller and LoRa communication modules with a customized PCB design to integrate all the hardware. This enables SPARC-LoRa to achieve low power consumption, long range communication, and low cost. With a new connection-based upper layer protocol design, the scalability and communication reliability of SPARC-loRa can be achieved. Second, an open source software including sensor nodes and servers is designed based on Docker container with cloud storage, computing, and LTE functionalities. In order to achieve reliable wireless communication under extreme conditions, a relay module is designed and applied to SPARC-LoRa to forward the data from sensor nodes to the gateway node. The system design and implementation is completely open source and hosted on the DigitalOcean Droplet Cloud. Hence, the proposed system enables further research and applications in both academia and industry. The proposed system has been tested in real fields under different and extreme environmental conditions in Salt Lake City, Utah and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The experimental results validate the features of SPARC-LoRa including low power, reliability, and cloud services provided by SPARC-LoRa.\nAgricultural Recommendation System based on Deep Learning: A Multivariate Weather Forecasting Approach\t\"Md Zubair, \n      \n      Md.

Sarker\"\t2024/07/11\tAgriculture plays a fundamental role in driving economic growth and ensuring food security for populations around the world. Although labor-intensive agriculture has led to steady increases in food grain production in many developing countries, it is frequently challenged by adverse weather conditions, including heavy rainfall, low temperatures, and drought. These factors substantially hinder food production, posing significant risks to global food security. In order to have a profitable, sustainable, and farmer-friendly agricultural practice, this paper proposes a context-based crop recommendation system powered by a weather forecast model. For implementation purposes, we have considered the whole territory of Bangladesh. With extensive evaluation, the multivariate Stacked Bi-LSTM (three Bi-LSTM layers with a time Distributed layer) Network is employed as the weather forecasting model. The proposed weather model can forecast Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity, and Sunshine for any given location in Bangladesh with an average R-Squared value of 0.9824, and the model outperforms other state-of-the-art LSTM models. These predictions guide our system in generating viable farming decisions.",

The object detector, You Look Only Once (YOLO), has gained popularity in agriculture in a relatively short span due to its state-of-the-art performance. YOLO offers real-time detection with good accuracy and is implemented in various agricultural tasks, including monitoring, surveillance, sensing, automation, and robotics. The research and application of YOLO in agriculture are accelerating rapidly but are fragmented and multidisciplinary. Moreover, the performance characteristics (i.e., accuracy, speed, computation) of the object detector influence the rate of technology implementation and adoption in agriculture. Thus, the study aims to collect extensive literature to document and critically evaluate the advances and application of YOLO for agricultural object recognition. First, we conducted a bibliometric review of 257 articles to understand the scholarly landscape of YOLO in agricultural domain. Secondly, we conducted a systematic review of 30 articles to identify current knowledge, gaps, and modifications in YOLO for specific agricultural tasks. The study critically assesses and summarizes the information on YOLO's end-to-end learning approach, including data acquisition, processing, network modification, integration, and deployment. We also discussed task-specific YOLO algorithm modification and integration to meet the agricultural object or environment-specific challenges. In general, YOLO-integrated digital tools and technologies show the potential for real-time, automated monitoring, surveillance, and object handling to reduce labor, production cost, and environmental impact while maximizing resource efficiency. The study provides detailed documentation and significantly advances the existing knowledge on applying YOLO in agriculture, which can greatly benefit the scientific community.\nA Framework for Agricultural Food Supply Chain using Blockchain\tSudarssan N\t2024/01/13\tThe main aim of the paper is to create a trust and transparency in the food supply chain system, ensuring food safety for everyone with the help of Blockchain Technology. Food supply chain is the process of tracing a crop from the farmer or producer to the buyer. With the advent of blockchain, providing a safe and fraud-free environment for the provision of numerous agricultural necessities has become much easier. Because of the globalization of trade, the present supply chain market today includes various companies involving integration of data, complex transactions and distribution. Information tamper resistance, supply-demand relationships, and traceable oversight are all difficulties that arise as a result of this. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that can provide information that is resistant to tampering. This strategy can eliminate the need for a centralized trusted authority, intermediaries, and business histories, allowing for increased production and security while maintaining the highest levels of integrity, liability, and safety. In order to have an integrity and transparency in food supply chain in the agricultural sector, a framework is proposed here based on block chain and IoT.\nEnhancing Rural Agricultural Value Chains through Electric Mobility Services in Ethiopia\t\"Clemens Pizzinini, \n      \n      Philipp Rosner, \n      \n      David Ziegler, \n      \n      Markus Lienkamp\"\t2024/01/17\tTransportation is a constitutional part of most supply and value chains in modern economies. Smallholder farmers in rural Ethiopia face severe challenges along their supply and value chains. In particular, suitable, affordable, and available transport services are in high demand. To develop context-specific technical solutions, a problem-to-solution methodology based on the interaction with technology is developed. With this approach, we fill the gap between proven transportation assessment frameworks and general user-centered techniques. Central to our approach is an electric test vehicle that is implemented in rural supply and value chains for research, development, and testing. Based on our objective and the derived methodological requirements, a set of existing methods is selected. Local partners are integrated in an organizational framework that executes major parts of this research endeavour in Arsi Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia.\nMulti-Scale Analysis of Agricultural Drought Propagation on the Iberian Peninsula Using Non-Parametric Indices\t\"M.

The mechanisms underlying the transition from meteorological to agricultural drought and its features were investigated. Various non-parametric standardized drought indices were utilized. For meteorological droughts, the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was employed, while the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI), Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI), and Standard Precipitation, Evapotranspiration and Soil Moisture Index (SPESMI) were utilized for agricultural droughts, while their ability to identify relative vegetation stress in areas affected by severe droughts was investigated using the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (F",

A statistical approach based on run theory was employed to analyze several characteristics of drought propagation, such as response time scale, propagation probability, and lag time at monthly, seasonal, and six-month time scales. The retrieved response time scale was fast, about 1-2 months, and the probability of occurrence increased with the severity of the originating meteorological drought. The duration of agricultural drought was shorter than that of meteorological drought, with a delayed onset but the same term. The results obtained by multi-variate indices showed a more rapid propagation process and a tendency to identify more severe events than uni-variate indices. In general terms, agricultural indices were found to be effective in assessing vegetation stress in the Iberian Peninsula. A newly developed combined agricultural drought index was found to balance the characteristics of the other adopted indices and may be useful for future studies.\nRAG vs Fine-tuning: Pipelines, Tradeoffs, and a Case Study on Agriculture\t\"Angels Balaguer, \n      \n      Vinamra Benara, \n      \n      Renato Luiz de Freitas Cunha, \n      \n      Roberto de M.

RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself. However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results. We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline. We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer? Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%. Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.\nAGSPNet: A framework for parcel-scale crop fine-grained semantic change detection from UAV high-resolution imagery with agricultural geographic scene constraints\t\"Shaochun Li, \n      \n      Yanjun Wang, \n      \n      Hengfan Cai, \n      \n      Lina Deng, \n      \n      Yunhao Lin\"\t2024/01/11\tReal-time and accurate information on fine-grained changes in crop cultivation is of great significance for crop growth monitoring, yield prediction and agricultural structure adjustment. Aiming at the problems of serious spectral confusion in visible high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images of different phases, interference of large complex background and salt-and-pepper noise by existing semantic change detection (SCD) algorithms, in order to effectively extract deep image features of crops and meet the demand of agricultural practical engineering applications, this paper designs and proposes an agricultural geographic scene and parcel-scale constrained SCD framework for crops (AGSPNet). AGSPNet framework contains three parts: agricultural geographic scene (AGS) division module, parcel edge extraction module and crop SCD module. Meanwhile, we produce and introduce an UAV image SCD dataset (CSCD) dedicated to agricultural monitoring, encompassing multiple semantic variation types of crops in complex geographical scene. We conduct comparative experiments and accuracy evaluations in two test areas of this dataset, and the results show that the crop SCD results of AGSPNet consistently outperform other deep learning SCD models in terms of quantity and quality, with the evaluation metrics F1-score, kappa, OA, and mIoU obtaining improvements of 0.038, 0.021, 0.011 and 0.062, respectively, on average over the sub-optimal method.

We propose an end-to-end trainable learning network (DedustNet) to solve the real-world agricultural dust removal task. To our knowledge, DedustNet is the first time Swin Transformer-based units have been used in wavelet networks for agricultural image dusting. Specifically, we present the frequency-dominated block (DWTFormer block and IDWTFormer block) by adding a spatial features aggregation scheme (SFAS) to the Swin Transformer and combining it with the wavelet transform, the DWTFormer block and IDWTFormer block, alleviating the limitation of the global receptive field of Swin Transformer when dealing with complex dusty backgrounds. Furthermore, We propose a cross-level information fusion module to fuse different levels of features and effectively capture global and long-range feature relationships. In addition, we present a dilated convolution module to capture contextual information guided by wavelet transform at multiple scales, which combines the advantages of wavelet transform and dilated convolution. Our algorithm leverages deep learning techniques to effectively remove dust from images while preserving the original structural and textural features. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, DedustNet achieves superior performance and more reliable results in agricultural image dedusting, providing strong support for the application of agricultural machinery in dusty environments. Additionally, the impressive performance on real-world hazy datasets and application tests highlights DedustNet superior generalization ability and computer vision-related application performance.\nLearning-based agricultural management in partially observable environments subject to climate variability\t\"Zhaoan Wang, \n      \n      Shaoping Xiao, \n      \n      Junchao Li, \n      \n      Jun Wang\"\t2024/01/02\tAgricultural management, with a particular focus on fertilization strategies, holds a central role in shaping crop yield, economic profitability, and environmental sustainability. While conventional guidelines offer valuable insights, their efficacy diminishes when confronted with extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves and droughts. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Leveraging the Gym-DSSAT simulator, we train an intelligent agent to master optimal nitrogen fertilization management. Through a series of simulation experiments conducted on corn crops in Iowa, we compare Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) models with Markov Decision Process (MDP) models. Our research underscores the advantages of utilizing sequential observations in developing more efficient nitrogen input policies. Additionally, we explore the impact of climate variability, particularly during extreme weather events, on agricultural outcomes and management. Our findings demonstrate the adaptability of fertilization policies to varying climate conditions. Notably, a fixed policy exhibits resilience in the face of minor climate fluctuations, leading to commendable corn yields, cost-effectiveness, and environmental conservation. However, our study illuminates the need for agent retraining to acquire new optimal policies under extreme weather events. This research charts a promising course toward adaptable fertilization strategies that can seamlessly align with dynamic climate scenarios, ultimately contributing to the optimization of crop management practices.\nAgricultural 4.0 Leveraging on Technological Solutions: Study for Smart Farming Sector\t\"Emmanuel Kojo Gyamfi, \n      \n      Zag ElSayed, \n      \n      Jess Kropczynski, \n      \n      Mustapha Awinsongya Yakubu, \n      \n      Nelly Elsayed\"\t2024/01/01\tBy 2050, it is predicted that there will be 9 billion people on the planet, which will call for more production, lower costs, and the preservation of natural resources.

Understanding the factors that influence consumer participation in CSA is crucial, yet the complete picture and interrelations of these factors remain unclear in existing studies. This research adopts a scoping review and the KJ method to elucidate the factors influencing consumer participation in CSA and to theorize the consumer participation. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of individual decision-making for participation, under the premise that individuals are embedded in socio-cultural environments. We examine the decision-making process based on the seesaw of expected gains and losses from participation, along with the reflexivity to the individual and the process of updating decision-making post-participation. Our study highlights how individual decision-making for participation is influenced by relationships with others within the embedded socio-cultural environment, as well as by attachment and connection to the community. It also shows that discrepancies between expectations and experiences post-participation, and the transformation of the social capital, promote the updating of decision-making processes. In addition, among the factors identified in this study for participation in CSA, the decision to participate was heavily influenced by expectations of variety of ingredients, suggesting that other factors such as food education and learning opportunities, contribution to environmental and social issues, and connections with people and nature had little impact. Although there are limitations, the insights gained from this study offer profound implications for stakeholders and provide valuable insights for more sustainable and efficient CSA practices.\nOn the Promises and Challenges of Multimodal Foundation Models for Geographical, Environmental, Agricultural, and Urban Planning Applications\t\"Chenjiao Tan, \n      \n      Qian Cao, \n      \n      Yiwei Li, \n      \n      Jielu Zhang, \n      \n      Xiao Yang, \n      \n      Huaqin Zhao, \n      \n      Zihao Wu, \n      \n      Zhengliang Liu, \n      \n      Hao Yang, \n      \n      Nemin Wu, \n      \n      Tao Tang, \n      \n      Xinyue Ye, \n      \n      Lilong Chai, \n      \n      Ninghao Liu, \n      \n      Changying Li, \n      \n      Lan Mu, \n      \n      Tianming Liu, \n      \n      Gengchen Mai\"\t2023/12/23\tThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has heightened interest in their potential for multimodal applications that integrate language and vision. This paper explores the capabilities of GPT-4V in the realms of geography, environmental science, agriculture, and urban planning by evaluating its performance across a variety of tasks. Data sources comprise satellite imagery, aerial photos, ground-level images, field images, and public datasets. The model is evaluated on a series of tasks including geo-localization, textual data extraction from maps, remote sensing image classification, visual question answering, crop type identification, disease/pest/weed recognition, chicken behavior analysis, agricultural object counting, urban planning knowledge question answering, and plan generation. The results indicate the potential of GPT-4V in geo-localization, land cover classification, visual question answering, and basic image understanding. However, there are limitations in several tasks requiring fine-grained recognition and precise counting. While zero-shot learning shows promise, performance varies across problem domains and image complexities. The work provides novel insights into GPT-4V's capabilities and limitations for real-world geospatial, environmental, agricultural, and urban planning challenges. Further research should focus on augmenting the model's knowledge and reasoning for specialized domains through expanded training.

There are rapid advances in information and communication technology, precision agriculture and data analytics, which are creating a fertile field for the creation of smart connected farms (SCF) and networked farmers. A network and coordinated farmer network provides unique advantages to farmers to enhance farm production and profitability, while tackling adverse climate events. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in SCF including the advances in engineering, computer sciences, data sciences, social sciences and economics including data privacy, sharing and technology adoption.\nOvercome the Fear Of Missing Out: Active Sensing UAV Scanning for Precision Agriculture\t\"Marios Krestenitis, \n      \n      Emmanuel K. Raptis, \n      \n      Athanasios Ch. Kapoutsis, \n      \n      Konstantinos Ioannidis, \n      \n      Elias B. Kosmatopoulos, \n      \n      Stefanos Vrochidis\"\t2023/12/15\tThis paper deals with the problem of informative path planning for a UAV deployed for precision agriculture applications. First, we observe that the ``fear of missing out'' data lead to uniform, conservative scanning policies over the whole agricultural field. Consequently, employing a non-uniform scanning approach can mitigate the expenditure of time in areas with minimal or negligible real value, while ensuring heightened precision in information-dense regions. Turning to the available informative path planning methodologies, we discern that certain methods entail intensive computational requirements, while others necessitate training on an ideal world simulator. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an active sensing coverage path planning approach, named OverFOMO, that regulates the speed of the UAV in accordance with both the relative quantity of the identified classes, i.e. crops and weeds, and the confidence level of such detections. To identify these instances, a robust Deep Learning segmentation model is deployed. The computational needs of the proposed algorithm are independent of the size of the agricultural field, rendering its applicability on modern UAVs quite straightforward. The proposed algorithm was evaluated with a simu-realistic pipeline, combining data from real UAV missions and the high-fidelity dynamics of AirSim simulator, showcasing its performance improvements over the established state of affairs for this type of missions. An open-source implementation of the algorithm and the evaluation pipeline is also available: \\url{https://github.com/emmarapt/OverFOMO}.\nFacilitating Digital Agriculture with Simple Databases\t\"Dennis Buckmaster, \n      \n      Sami Basir, \n      \n      Hanae Sakata\"\t2023/12/11\tAs an on-ramp to databases, we offer several well-structured private database templates as open source resources for agriculturalists, particularly those with modest spreadsheet skills.

Such data can facilitate logistics, provide contextual metadata, and improve enterprise analysis. A recorded workshop explaining how to build a database for activity records is presented. These resources may facilitate infusion of digital agriculture principles through Extension and structured educational programming.\nMulti-agricultural Machinery Collaborative Task Assignment Based on Improved Genetic Hybrid Optimization Algorithm\tHaohao Du\t2023/12/07\tTo address the challenges of delayed scheduling information, heavy reliance on manual labour, and low operational efficiency in traditional large-scale agricultural machinery operations, this study proposes a method for multi-agricultural machinery collaborative task assignment based on an improved genetic hybrid optimisation algorithm.

The proposed method establishes a multi-agricultural machinery task allocation model by combining the path pre-planning of a simulated annealing algorithm and the static task allocation of a genetic algorithm. By sequentially fusing these two algorithms, their respective shortcomings can be overcome, and their advantages in global and local search can be utilised. Consequently, the search capability of the population is enhanced, leading to the discovery of more optimal solutions. Then, an adaptive crossover operator is constructed according to the task assignment model, considering the capacity, path cost, and time of agricultural machinery; two-segment coding and multi-population adaptive mutation are used to assign tasks to improve the diversity of the population and enhance the exploration ability of the population; and to improve the global optimisation ability of the hybrid algorithm, a 2-Opt local optimisation operator and an Circle modification algorithm are introduced. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted in MATLAB to evaluate the performance of the multi-agricultural machinery collaborative task assignment based on the improved genetic hybrid algorithm. The algorithm's capabilities were assessed through comparative analysis in the simulation trials. The results demonstrate that the developed hybrid algorithm can effectively reduce path costs, and the efficiency of the assignment outcomes surpasses that of the classical genetic algorithm. This approach proves particularly suitable for addressing large-scale task allocation problems.\nData-Centric Digital Agriculture: A Perspective\t\"Ribana Roscher, \n      \n      Lukas Roth, \n      \n      Cyrill Stachniss, \n      \n      Achim Walter\"\t2023/12/06\tIn response to the increasing global demand for food, feed, fiber, and fuel, digital agriculture is rapidly evolving to meet these demands while reducing environmental impact. This evolution involves incorporating data science, machine learning, sensor technologies, robotics, and new management strategies to establish a more sustainable agricultural framework. So far, machine learning research in digital agriculture has predominantly focused on model-centric approaches, focusing on model design and evaluation. These efforts aim to optimize model accuracy and efficiency, often treating data as a static benchmark. Despite the availability of agricultural data and methodological advancements, a saturation point has been reached, with many established machine learning methods achieving comparable levels of accuracy and facing similar limitations. To fully realize the potential of digital agriculture, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the role of data in the field and to adopt data-centric machine learning. This involves developing strategies to acquire and curate valuable data and implementing effective learning and evaluation strategies that utilize the intrinsic value of data. This approach has the potential to create accurate, generalizable, and adaptable machine learning methods that effectively and sustainably address agricultural tasks such as yield prediction, weed detection, and early disease identification\nInnovations in Agricultural Forecasting: A Multivariate Regression Study on Global Crop Yield Prediction\t\"Ishaan Gupta, \n      \n      Samyutha Ayalasomayajula, \n      \n      Yashas Shashidhara, \n      \n      Anish Kataria, \n      \n      Shreyas Shashidhara, \n      \n      Krishita Kataria, \n      \n      Aditya Undurti\"\t2024/03/14\tThe prediction of crop yields internationally is a crucial objective in agricultural research. Thus, this study implements 6 regression models (Linear, Tree, Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting, K Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest) to predict crop yields in 37 developing countries over 27 years. Given 4 key training parameters, insecticides (tonnes), rainfall (mm), temperature (Celsius), and yield (hg/ha), it was found that our Random Forest Regression model achieved a determination coefficient (r2) of 0.94, with a margin of error (ME) of .03. The models were trained and tested using the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations data, along with the World Bank Climate Change Data Catalog. Furthermore, each parameter was analyzed to understand how varying factors could impact overall yield. We used unconventional models, contrary to generally used Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) models, combined with recently collected data to implement a unique approach in our research. Existing scholarship would benefit from understanding the most optimal model for agricultural research, specifically using the United Nations data.\nVisualization and Characterization of Agricultural Sprays Using Machine Learning based Digital Inline Holography\t\"Shyam Kumar M, \n      \n      Christopher J.

Compared to non-ML methods, our method enhances accuracy, generalizability, and processing speed. Our approach employs two neural networks: a modified U-Net to obtain the 3D droplet field from the numerically reconstructed optical field, followed by a VGG16 classifier to reduce false positives from the U-Net prediction. The modified U-Net is trained using holograms generated using a single spray nozzle at three spray locations; center, half-span, and the spray edge to create training data with various number densities and droplet size ranges.

Additionally, the ML-based DIH enables the estimation of mass and momentum flux at different locations and the calculation of relative velocities of droplet pairs, which are difficult to obtain via conventional techniques.\nAdvances in soft grasping in agriculture\tAli Leylavi Shoushtari\t2023/11/30\tAgricultural robotics and automation are facing some challenges rooted in the high variability 9 of products, task complexity, crop quality requirement, and dense vegetation. Such a set of 10 challenges demands a more versatile and safe robotic system. Soft robotics is a young yet 11 promising field of research aimed to enhance these aspects of current rigid robots which 12 makes it a good candidate solution for that challenge. In general, it aimed to provide robots 13 and machines with adaptive locomotion (Ansari et al., 2015), safe and adaptive manipulation 14 (Arleo et al., 2020) and versatile grasping (Langowski et al., 2020). But in agriculture, soft 15 robots have been mainly used in harvesting tasks and more specifically in grasping. In this 16 chapter, we review a candidate group of soft grippers that were used for handling and 17 harvesting crops regarding agricultural challenges i.e. safety in handling and adaptability to 18 the high variation of crops. The review is aimed to show why and to what extent soft grippers 19 have been successful in handling agricultural tasks. The analysis carried out on the results 20 provides future directions for the systematic design of soft robots in agricultural tasks.\nPrivacy-Preserving Data Sharing in Agriculture: Enforcing Policy Rules for Secure and Confidential Data Synthesis\t\"Anantaa Kotal, \n      \n      Lavanya Elluri, \n      \n      Deepti Gupta, \n      \n      Varun Mandalapu, \n      \n      Anupam Joshi\"\t2023/11/26\tBig Data empowers the farming community with the information needed to optimize resource usage, increase productivity, and enhance the sustainability of agricultural practices. The use of Big Data in farming requires the collection and analysis of data from various sources such as sensors, satellites, and farmer surveys. While Big Data can provide the farming community with valuable insights and improve efficiency, there is significant concern regarding the security of this data as well as the privacy of the participants. Privacy regulations, such as the EU GDPR, the EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement, and the proposed EU AI law, have been created to address the issue of data privacy and provide specific guidelines on when and how data can be shared between organizations. To make confidential agricultural data widely available for Big Data analysis without violating the privacy of the data subjects, we consider privacy-preserving methods of data sharing in agriculture. Deep learning-based synthetic data generation has been proposed for privacy-preserving data sharing. However, there is a lack of compliance with documented data privacy policies in such privacy-preserving efforts. In this study, we propose a novel framework for enforcing privacy policy rules in privacy-preserving data generation algorithms. We explore several available agricultural codes of conduct, extract knowledge related to the privacy constraints in data, and use the extracted knowledge to define privacy bounds in a privacy-preserving generative model. We use our framework to generate synthetic agricultural data and present experimental results that demonstrate the utility of the synthetic dataset in downstream tasks. We also show that our framework can evade potential threats and secure data based on applicable regulatory policy rules.\nCan SAM recognize crops?

To tackle the growing challenges in feeding the planet, cutting-edge management strategies, such as precision agriculture, empower farmers and decision-makers with rich and actionable information to increase the efficiency and sustainability of their farming practices. Crop-type maps are key information for decision-support tools but are challenging and costly to generate. We investigate the capabilities of Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for crop-map prediction task, acknowledging its recent successes at zero-shot image segmentation. However, SAM being limited to up-to 3 channel inputs and its zero-shot usage being class-agnostic in nature pose unique challenges in using it directly for crop-type mapping. We propose using clustering consensus metrics to assess SAM's zero-shot performance in segmenting satellite imagery and producing crop-type maps. Although direct crop-type mapping is challenging using SAM in zero-shot setting, experiments reveal SAM's potential for swiftly and accurately outlining fields in satellite images, serving as a foundation for subsequent crop classification.

Coelho, \n      \n      M. Fernanda P. Costa, \n      \n      L. L. Ferrás\"\t2023/11/22\t\"Hydropower plants are crucial for stable renewable energy and serve as vital water sources for sustainable agriculture. However, it is essential to assess the current water management practices associated with hydropower plant management software. A key concern is the potential conflict between electricity generation and agricultural water needs. Prioritising water for electricity generation can reduce irrigation availability in agriculture during crucial periods like droughts, impacting crop yields and regional food security. Coordination between electricity and agricultural water allocation is necessary to ensure optimal and environmentally sound practices. Neural networks have become valuable tools for hydropower plant management, but their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency in decision making. Additionally, current approaches often do not take advantage of their potential to create a system that effectively balances water allocation.\n  This work is a call for attention and highlights the potential risks of deploying neural network-based hydropower plant management software without proper scrutiny and control. To address these concerns, we propose the adoption of the Agriculture Conscious Hydropower Plant Management framework, aiming to maximise electricity production while prioritising stable irrigation for agriculture. We also advocate reevaluating government-imposed minimum water guidelines for irrigation to ensure flexibility and effective water allocation. Additionally, we suggest a set of regulatory measures to promote model transparency and robustness, certifying software that makes conscious and intelligent water allocation decisions, ultimately safeguarding agriculture from undue strain during droughts.\"\nAI for Agriculture: the Comparison of Semantic Segmentation Methods for Crop Mapping with Sentinel-2 Imagery\t\"Irina Korotkova, \n      \n      Natalia Efremova\"\t2023/11/21\tCrop mapping is one of the most common tasks in artificial intelligence for agriculture due to higher food demands from a growing population and increased awareness of climate change. In case of vineyards, the texture is very important for crop segmentation: with higher resolution satellite imagery the texture is easily detected by majority of state-of-the-art algorithms. However, this task becomes increasingly more difficult as the resolution of satellite imagery decreases and the information about the texture becomes unavailable. In this paper we aim to explore the main machine learning methods that can be used with freely available satellite imagery and discuss how and when they can be applied for vineyard segmentation problem. We assess the effectiveness of various widely-used machine learning techniques and offer guidance on selecting the most suitable model for specific scenarios.\nA Video-Based Activity Classification of Human Pickers in Agriculture\t\"Abhishesh Pal, \n      \n      Antonio C.

Based on this, deploying a fleet of autonomous robots to work alongside farmworkers may provide vast productivity and logistics benefits. Then, an intelligent robotic system should monitor human behavior, identify the ongoing activities and anticipate the worker's needs. In this work, the main contribution consists of creating a benchmark model for video-based human pickers detection, classifying their activities to serve in harvesting operations for different agricultural scenarios. Our solution uses the combination of a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) for object detection and optical flow for motion estimation with newly added statistical attributes of flow motion descriptors, named as Correlation Sensitivity (CS). A classification criterion is defined based on the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) analysis and K-means clustering algorithm, which are implemented upon in-house collected dataset from different crop fields like strawberry polytunnels and apple tree orchards. The proposed framework is quantitatively analyzed using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measures and shows satisfactory results amidst various dataset challenges such as lighting variation, blur, and occlusions.\nChatGPT in the context of precision agriculture data analytics\tIlyas Potamitis\t2023/11/10\tIn this study we argue that integrating ChatGPT into the data processing pipeline of automated sensors in precision agriculture has the potential to bring several benefits and enhance various aspects of modern farming practices. Policy makers often face a barrier when they need to get informed about the situation in vast agricultural fields to reach to decisions. They depend on the close collaboration between agricultural experts in the field, data analysts, and technology providers to create interdisciplinary teams that cannot always be secured on demand or establish effective communication across these diverse domains to respond in real-time. In this work we argue that the speech recognition input modality of ChatGPT provides a more intuitive and natural way for policy makers to interact with the database of the server of an agricultural data processing system to which a large, dispersed network of automated insect traps and sensors probes reports. The large language models map the speech input to text, allowing the user to form its own version of unconstrained verbal query, raising the barrier of having to learn and adapt oneself to a specific data analytics software.

Plant diseases, however, can negatively affect leaves during agricultural cultivation, resulting in significant losses in crop output and economic value. Therefore, it is crucial for farmers to identify crop diseases. However, this method frequently necessitates hard work, a lot of planning, and in-depth familiarity with plant pathogens. Given these numerous obstacles, it is essential to provide solutions that can easily interface with mobile and IoT devices so that our farmers can guarantee the best possible crop development. Various machine learning (ML) as well as deep learning (DL) algorithms have been created & studied for the identification of plant disease detection, yielding substantial and promising results. This article presents a novel classification method that builds on prior work by utilising attention-based feature extraction, RGB channel-based chromatic analysis, Support Vector Machines (SVM) for improved performance, and the ability to integrate with mobile applications and IoT devices after quantization of information. Several disease classification algorithms were compared with the suggested model, and it was discovered that, in terms of accuracy, Vision Transformer-based feature extraction and additional Green Chromatic Coordinate feature with SVM classification achieved an accuracy of (GCCViT-SVM) - 99.69%, whereas after quantization for IoT device integration achieved an accuracy of - 97.41% while almost reducing 4x in size.

Focusing on the impact of the conflict on the global agricultural market, we propose a new analytical framework for tail dependence, and combine the Copula-CoVaR method with the ARMA-GARCH-skewed Student-t model to examine the tail dependence structure and extreme risk spillover between agricultural futures and spots over the pre- and post-outbreak periods. Our results indicate that the tail dependence structures in the futures-spot markets of soybean, maize, wheat, and rice have all reacted to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Furthermore, the outbreak of the conflict has intensified risks of the four agricultural markets in varying degrees, with the wheat market being affected the most. Additionally, all the agricultural futures markets exhibit significant downside and upside risk spillovers to their corresponding spot markets before and after the outbreak of the conflict, whereas the strengths of these extreme risk spillover effects demonstrate significant asymmetries at the directional (downside versus upside) and temporal (pre-outbreak versus post-outbreak) levels.\nCorrelation structure analysis of the global agricultural futures market\t\"Yun-Shi Dai, \n      \n      Ngoc Quang Anh Huynh, \n      \n      Qing-Huan Zheng, \n      \n      Wei-Xing Zhou\"\t2023/10/24\tThis paper adopts the random matrix theory (RMT) to analyze the correlation structure of the global agricultural futures market from 2000 to 2020. It is found that the distribution of correlation coefficients is asymmetric and right skewed, and many eigenvalues of the correlation matrix deviate from the RMT prediction. The largest eigenvalue reflects a collective market effect common to all agricultural futures, the other largest deviating eigenvalues can be implemented to identify futures groups, and there are modular structures based on regional properties or agricultural commodities among the significant participants of their corresponding eigenvectors. Except for the smallest eigenvalue, other smallest deviating eigenvalues represent the agricultural futures pairs with highest correlations. This paper can be of reference and significance for using agricultural futures to manage risk and optimize asset allocation.\nClimate-related Agricultural Productivity Losses through a Poverty Lens\tAlkis Blanz\t2023/10/30\tIn this paper, we analyze the long-term distributive impact of climate change through rising food prices. We use a standard incomplete markets model and account for non-linear Engel curves for food consumption. For the calibration of our model, we rely on household data from 92 developing countries, representing 4.5 billion people. The results indicate that the short-term and long-term distributive impact of climate change differs. Including general equilibrium effects change the welfare outcome especially for the poorest quintile. In the presence of idiosyncratic risk, higher food prices increase precautionary savings, which through general equilibrium affect labor income of all agents. Furthermore, this paper studies the impact on inequality for different allocations of productivity losses across sectors. When climate impacts affects total factor productivity in both sectors of the economy, climate impacts increase also wealth inequality.\nComparison of Unscented Kalman Filter Design for Agricultural Anaerobic Digestion Model\t\"Simon Hellmann, \n      \n      Terrance Wilms, \n      \n      Stefan Streif, \n      \n      Sören Weinrich\"\t2024/08/06\tDynamic operation of biological processes, such as anaerobic digestion (AD), requires reliable process monitoring to guarantee stable operating conditions at all times. Unscented Kalman filters (UKF) are an established tool for nonlinear state estimation, and there exist numerous variants of UKF implementations, treating state constraints, improvements of numerical performance and different noise cases. So far, however, a unified comparison of proposed methods emphasizing the algorithmic details is lacking. The present study thus examines multiple unconstrained and constrained UKF variants, addresses aspects crucial for direct implementation and applies them to a simplified AD model. The constrained UKF considering additive noise delivered the most accurate state estimations. The long run time of the underlying optimization could be vastly reduced through pre-calculated gradients and Hessian of the associated cost function, as well as by reformulation of the cost function as a quadratic program. However, unconstrained UKF variants showed lower run times at competitive estimation accuracy. This study provides useful advice to practitioners working with nonlinear Kalman filters by paying close attention to algorithmic details and modifications crucial for successful implementation.\nClimate Change Impact on Agricultural Land Suitability: An Interpretable Machine Learning-Based Eurasia Case Study\t\"Valeriy Shevchenko, \n      \n      Daria Taniushkina, \n      \n      Aleksander Lukashevich, \n      \n      Aleksandr Bulkin, \n      \n      Roland Grinis, \n      \n      Kirill Kovalev, \n      \n      Veronika Narozhnaia, \n      \n      Nazar Sotiriadi, \n      \n      Alexander Krenke, \n      \n      Yury Maximov\"\t2023/10/24\t\"The United Nations has identified improving food security and reducing hunger as essential components of its sustainable development goals.

As of 2021, approximately 828 million people worldwide are experiencing hunger and malnutrition, with numerous fatalities reported. Climate change significantly impacts agricultural land suitability, potentially leading to severe food shortages and subsequent social and political conflicts. To address this pressing issue, we have developed a machine learning-based approach to predict the risk of substantial land suitability degradation and changes in irrigation patterns. Our study focuses on Central Eurasia, a region burdened with economic and social challenges.\n  This study represents a pioneering effort in utilizing machine learning methods to assess the impact of climate change on agricultural land suitability under various carbon emissions scenarios. Through comprehensive feature importance analysis, we unveil specific climate and terrain characteristics that exert influence on land suitability. Our approach achieves remarkable accuracy, offering policymakers invaluable insights to facilitate informed decisions aimed at averting a humanitarian crisis, including strategies such as the provision of additional water and fertilizers. This research underscores the tremendous potential of machine learning in addressing global challenges, with a particular emphasis on mitigating hunger and malnutrition.\"\nFusion-Driven Tree Reconstruction and Fruit Localization: Advancing Precision in Agriculture\t\"Kaiming Fu, \n      \n      Peng Wei, \n      \n      Juan Villacres, \n      \n      Zhaodan Kong, \n      \n      Stavros G.

This study introduces an innovative methodology that harnesses the synergy of RGB imagery, LiDAR, and IMU data, to achieve intricate tree reconstructions and the pinpoint localization of fruits. Such integration not only offers insights into the fruit distribution, which enhances the precision of guidance for agricultural robotics and automation systems, but also sets the stage for simulating synthetic fruit patterns across varied tree architectures. To validate this approach, experiments have been carried out in both a controlled environment and an actual peach orchard. The results underscore the robustness and efficacy of this fusion-driven methodology, highlighting its potential as a transformative tool for future agricultural robotics and precision farming.\nExploratory functional data analysis of multivariate densities for the identification of agricultural soil contamination by risk elements\t\"Tomáš Matys Grygar, \n      \n      Una Radojičić, \n      \n      Ivana Pavlů, \n      \n      Sonja Greven, \n      \n      Johanna Genest Nešlehová, \n      \n      Štěpánka Tůmová, \n      \n      Karel Hron\"\t2023/11/06\tGeochemical mapping of risk element concentrations in soils is performed in countries around the world. It results in large datasets of high analytical quality, which can be used to identify soils that violate individual legislative limits for safe food production. However, there is a lack of advanced data mining tools that would be suitable for sensitive exploratory data analysis of big data while respecting the natural variability of soil composition. To distinguish anthropogenic contamination from natural variation, the analysis of the entire data distributions for smaller sub-areas is key. In this article, we propose a new data mining method for geochemical mapping data based on functional data analysis of probability density functions in the framework of Bayes spaces after post-stratification of a big dataset to smaller districts. Proposed tools allow us to analyse the entire distribution, going beyond a superficial detection of extreme concentration anomalies. We illustrate the proposed methodology on a dataset gathered according to the Czech national legislation (1990--2009). Taking into account specific properties of probability density functions and recent results for orthogonal decomposition of multivariate densities enabled us to reveal real contamination patterns that were so far only suspected in Czech agricultural soils. We process the above Czech soil composition dataset by first compartmentalising it into spatial units, in particular the districts, and by subsequently clustering these districts according to diagnostic features of their uni- and multivariate distributions at high concentration ends. Comparison between compartments is key to the reliable distinction of diffuse contamination. In this work, we used soil contamination by Cu-bearing pesticides as an example for empirical testing of the proposed data mining approach.\nMachine Learning-based Nutrient Application's Timeline Recommendation for Smart Agriculture: A Large-Scale Data Mining Approach\t\"Usama Ikhlaq, \n      \n      Tahar Kechadi\"\t2023/10/18\tThis study addresses the vital role of data analytics in monitoring fertiliser applications in crop cultivation. Inaccurate fertiliser application decisions can lead to costly consequences, hinder food production, and cause environmental harm. We propose a solution to predict nutrient application by determining required fertiliser quantities for an entire season. The proposed solution recommends adjusting fertiliser amounts based on weather conditions and soil characteristics to promote cost-effective and environmentally friendly agriculture. The collected dataset is high-dimensional and heterogeneous. Our research examines large-scale heterogeneous datasets in the context of the decision-making process, encompassing data collection and analysis. We also study the impact of fertiliser applications combined with weather data on crop yield, using the winter wheat crop as a case study. By understanding local contextual and geographic factors, we aspire to stabilise or even reduce the demand for agricultural nutrients while enhancing crop development. The proposed approach is proven to be efficient and scalable, as it is validated using a real-world and large dataset.\nGPT-4 as an Agronomist Assistant?

For some tasks, LLMs achieve similar or better performance than trained human beings, therefore it is reasonable to employ human exams (e.g., certification tests) to assess the performance of LLMs. We present a comprehensive evaluation of popular LLMs, such as Llama 2 and GPT, on their ability to answer agriculture-related questions. In our evaluation, we also employ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and ER (Ensemble Refinement) techniques, which combine information retrieval, generation capabilities, and prompting strategies to improve the LLMs' performance. To demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs, we selected agriculture exams and benchmark datasets from three of the largest agriculture producer countries: Brazil, India, and the USA. Our analysis highlights GPT-4's ability to achieve a passing score on exams to earn credits for renewing agronomist certifications, answering 93% of the questions correctly and outperforming earlier general-purpose models, which achieved 88% accuracy. On one of our experiments, GPT-4 obtained the highest performance when compared to human subjects. This performance suggests that GPT-4 could potentially pass on major graduate education admission tests or even earn credits for renewing agronomy certificates. We also explore the models' capacity to address general agriculture-related questions and generate crop management guidelines for Brazilian and Indian farmers, utilizing robust datasets from the Brazilian Agency of Agriculture (Embrapa) and graduate program exams from India. The results suggest that GPT-4, ER, and RAG can contribute meaningfully to agricultural education, assessment, and crop management practice, offering valuable insights to farmers and agricultural professionals.\nThe BELSAR dataset: Mono- and bistatic full-pol L-band SAR for agriculture and hydrology\t\"Jean Bouchat, \n      \n      Emma Tronquo, \n      \n      Anne Orban, \n      \n      Karlus A.

This innovative dataset, the collection of which was funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), helps addressing the lack of publicly-accessible experimental datasets combining multistatic SAR and in situ measurements. As such, it offers an opportunity to advance the development of SAR remote sensing science and applications for agricultural monitoring and hydrology. This paper aims to facilitate its adoption and exploration by offering comprehensive documentation and integrating its multiple data sources into a unified, analysis-ready dataset.\nDual mode multispectral imaging system for food and agricultural product quality estimation\t\"Darsha Udayanga, \n      \n      Ashan Serasinghe, \n      \n      Supun Dassanayake, \n      \n      Roshan Godaliyadda, \n      \n      H.

Malshan\"\t2023/10/04\tMultispectral imaging coupled with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Signal Processing techniques work as a feasible alternative for laboratory testing, especially in food quality control. Most of the recent related research has been focused on reflectance multispectral imaging but a system with both reflectance, transmittance capabilities would be ideal for a wide array of specimen types including solid and liquid samples. In this paper, a device which includes a dedicated reflectance mode and a dedicated transmittance mode is proposed. Dual mode operation where fast switching between two modes is facilitated. An innovative merged mode is introduced in which both reflectance and transmittance information of a specimen are combined to form a higher dimensional dataset with more features. Spatial and temporal variations of measurements are analyzed to ensure the quality of measurements. The concept is validated using a standard color palette and specific case studies are done for standard food samples such as turmeric powder and coconut oil proving the validity of proposed contributions. The classification accuracy of standard color palette testing was over 90% and the accuracy of coconut oil adulteration was over 95%. while the merged mode was able to provide the best accuracy of 99% for the turmeric adulteration. A linear functional mapping was done for coconut oil adulteration with an R2 value of 0.9558.\nTreeScope: An Agricultural Robotics Dataset for LiDAR-Based Mapping of Trees in Forests and Orchards\t\"Derek Cheng, \n      \n      Fernando Cladera Ojeda, \n      \n      Ankit Prabhu, \n      \n      Xu Liu, \n      \n      Alan Zhu, \n      \n      Patrick Corey Green, \n      \n      Reza Ehsani, \n      \n      Pratik Chaudhari, \n      \n      Vijay Kumar\"\t2023/10/03\tData collection for forestry, timber, and agriculture currently relies on manual techniques which are labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Polyzos, \n      \n      Henry J. Nelson, \n      \n      Georgios B. Giannakis, \n      \n      Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos\"\t2024/03/18\t3D reconstruction is a fundamental task in robotics that gained attention due to its major impact in a wide variety of practical settings, including agriculture, underwater, and urban environments. This task can be carried out via view planning (VP), which aims to optimally place a certain number of cameras in positions that maximize the visual information, improving the resulting 3D reconstruction. Nonetheless, in most real-world settings, existing environmental noise can significantly affect the performance of 3D reconstruction. To that end, this work advocates a novel geometric-based reconstruction quality function for VP, that accounts for the existing noise of the environment, without requiring its closed-form expression. With no analytic expression of the objective function, this work puts forth an adaptive Bayesian optimization algorithm for accurate 3D reconstruction in the presence of noise. Numerical tests on noisy agricultural environments showcase the merits of the proposed approach for 3D reconstruction with even a small number of available cameras.\nCoupled Active Perception and Manipulation Planning for a Mobile Manipulator in Precision Agriculture Applications\t\"Shuangyu Xie, \n      \n      Chengsong Hu, \n      \n      Di Wang, \n      \n      Joe Johnson, \n      \n      Muthukumar Bagavathiannan, \n      \n      Dezhen Song\"\t2023/09/28\tA mobile manipulator often finds itself in an application where it needs to take a close-up view before performing a manipulation task. Named this as a coupled active perception and manipulation (CAPM) problem, we model the uncertainty in the perception process and devise a key state/task planning approach that considers reachability conditions as task constraints of both perception and manipulation tasks for the mobile platform. By minimizing the expected energy usage in the body key state planning while satisfying task constraints, our algorithm achieves the best balance between the task success rate and energy usage. We have implemented the algorithm and tested it in both simulation and physical experiments. The results have confirmed that our algorithm has a lower energy consumption compared to a two-stage decoupled approach, while still maintaining a success rate of 100\\% for the task.\nAgriSORT: A Simple Online Real-time Tracking-by-Detection framework for robotics in precision agriculture\t\"Leonardo Saraceni, \n      \n      Ionut M. Motoi, \n      \n      Daniele Nardi, \n      \n      Thomas A. Ciarfuglia\"\t2023/09/28\tThe problem of multi-object tracking (MOT) consists in detecting and tracking all the objects in a video sequence while keeping a unique identifier for each object. It is a challenging and fundamental problem for robotics. In precision agriculture the challenge of achieving a satisfactory solution is amplified by extreme camera motion, sudden illumination changes, and strong occlusions. Most modern trackers rely on the appearance of objects rather than motion for association, which can be ineffective when most targets are static objects with the same appearance, as in the agricultural case. To this end, on the trail of SORT [5], we propose AgriSORT, a simple, online, real-time tracking-by-detection pipeline for precision agriculture based only on motion information that allows for accurate and fast propagation of tracks between frames. The main focuses of AgriSORT are efficiency, flexibility, minimal dependencies, and ease of deployment on robotic platforms. We test the proposed pipeline on a novel MOT benchmark specifically tailored for the agricultural context, based on video sequences taken in a table grape vineyard, particularly challenging due to strong self-similarity and density of the instances. Both the code and the dataset are available for future comparisons.\nFrom Text to Trends: A Unique Garden Analytics Perspective on the Future of Modern Agriculture\tParag Saxena\t2023/09/21\tData-driven insights are essential for modern agriculture.

Evidence from Indian Villages\tSuryadeepto Nag\t2023/09/17\tUsing a panel of 1,171 villages in rural India that were surveyed in the India Human Development Surveys, I perform a difference-in-differences analysis to find that improvements in electricity reliability have a negative effect on the increase in casual agricultural labor wage rates. Changes in men's wage rates are found to be affected more adversely than women's, resulting in a smaller widening of the gender wage gap. I find that better electricity reliability reduces the time spent by women in fuel collection substantially which could potentially increase labor supply. The demand for labor remains unaffected by reliability, which could lead the surplus in labor supply to cause wage rates to stunt. However, I show that electrical appliances such as groundwater pumps considerably increase labor demand indicating that governments could target increasing the adoption of electric pumps along with bettering the quality of electricity to absorb the surplus labor into agriculture.\nPAg-NeRF: Towards fast and efficient end-to-end panoptic 3D representations for agricultural robotics\t\"Claus Smitt, \n      \n      Michael Halstead, \n      \n      Patrick Zimmer, \n      \n      Thomas Läbe, \n      \n      Esra Guclu, \n      \n      Cyrill Stachniss, \n      \n      Chris McCool\"\t2023/09/11\tPrecise scene understanding is key for most robot monitoring and intervention tasks in agriculture. In this work we present PAg-NeRF which is a novel NeRF-based system that enables 3D panoptic scene understanding. Our representation is trained using an image sequence with noisy robot odometry poses and automatic panoptic predictions with inconsistent IDs between frames. Despite this noisy input, our system is able to output scene geometry, photo-realistic renders and 3D consistent panoptic representations with consistent instance IDs. We evaluate this novel system in a very challenging horticultural scenario and in doing so demonstrate an end-to-end trainable system that can make use of noisy robot poses rather than precise poses that have to be pre-calculated. Compared to a baseline approach the peak signal to noise ratio is improved from 21.34dB to 23.37dB while the panoptic quality improves from 56.65% to 70.08%. Furthermore, our approach is faster and can be tuned to improve inference time by more than a factor of 2 while being memory efficient with approximately 12 times fewer parameters.\nAgriculture Credit and Economic Growth in Bangladesh: A Time Series Analysis\t\"Md.

By employing Johansen cointegration test and vector error correction model (VECM), the study revealed that there exists a long run relationship between the variables. The results of the study showed that agriculture credit had a positive impact on GDP growth in Bangladesh. The study also found that gross capital formation had a positive, while inflation had a negative association with economic growth in Bangladesh. Therefore, the government and policymakers should continue their effort to increase the volume of agriculture credit to achieve sustainable economic growth.\nThe Agricultural Spraying Vehicle Routing Problem With Splittable Edge Demands\t\"Qian Wan, \n      \n      Rodolfo García-Flores, \n      \n      Simon A.

We are using theoretical insights about the optimal solution structure to improve the formulation and provide two different formulations of the splittable capacitated arc routing problem (SCARP), a basic spray formulation and a large edge demands formulation for large edge demands problems. This study presents solution methods consisting of lazy constraints, symmetry elimination constraints, and a heuristic repair method.

Detecting pests as early as possible can help increase crop yields and production efficiency. Several robotic monitoring systems have been developed allowing to collect data and provide a greater understanding of environmental processes. An agricultural robot can enable accurate timely detection of pests, by traversing the field autonomously and monitoring the entire cropped area within a field. However, in many cases it is impossible to sample all plants due to resource limitations. In this thesis, the development and evaluation of several sampling algorithms are presented to address the challenge of an agriculture-monitoring ground robot designed to locate insects in an agricultural field, where complete sampling of all the plants is infeasible. Two situations were investigated in simulation models that were specially developed as part of this thesis: where no a-priori information on the insects is available and where prior information on the insects distributions within the field is known. For the first situation, seven algorithms were tested, each utilizing an approach to sample the field without prior knowledge of it. For the second situation, we present the development and evaluation of a dynamic sampling algorithm which utilizes real-time information to prioritize sampling at suspected points, locate hot spots and adapt sampling plans accordingly. The algorithm's performance was compared to two existing algorithms using Tetranychidae insect data from previous research. Analyses revealed that the dynamic algorithm outperformed the others.\nAlternative Agriculture Land-Use Transformation Pathways by Partial-Equilibrium Agricultural Sector Model: A Mathematical Approach\t\"Malvika Kanojia, \n      \n      Prerna Kamani, \n      \n      Gautam Siddharth Kashyap, \n      \n      Shafaq Naz, \n      \n      Samar Wazir, \n      \n      Abhishek Chauhan\"\t2023/08/12\tHumanity's progress in combating hunger, poverty, and child mortality is marred by escalating environmental degradation due to rising greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts.

A study examines the interplay of land-use impacts, modeling crop and livestock trade, and their effects on climate, biodiversity, water, and land using a Partial-Equilibrium Agricultural Sector Model. Different scenarios involving taxing externalities related to Earth processes were tested. Results show synergies in reducing emissions, biodiversity loss, water use, and phosphorus pollution, driven by shifts in crop management. Nitrogen application and deforestation scenarios exhibit weaker synergies and more conflicts. The study offers insights into SDG interactions and the potential for sustainable farming.\nIntegrating Renewable Energy in Agriculture: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Approach\t\"A. Wahid, \n      \n      I faiud, \n      \n      K. Mason\"\t2023/08/16\tThis article investigates the use of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) to optimize decision-making for photovoltaic (PV) systems installations in the agriculture sector. The study develops a DQN framework to assist agricultural investors in making informed decisions considering factors such as installation budget, government incentives, energy requirements, system cost, and long-term benefits. By implementing a reward mechanism, the DQN learns to make data-driven decisions on PV integration. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how DQNs can support investors in making decisions about PV installations in agriculture. This research has significant implications for promoting sustainable and efficient farming practices while also paving the way for future advancements in this field. By leveraging DQNs, agricultural investors can make optimized decisions that improve energy efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and enhance profitability. This study contributes to the advancement of PV integration in agriculture and encourages further innovation in this promising area.\nTowards Temporal Edge Regression: A Case Study on Agriculture Trade Between Nations\t\"Lekang Jiang, \n      \n      Caiqi Zhang, \n      \n      Farimah Poursafaei, \n      \n      Shenyang Huang\"\t2023/08/15\tRecently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance in tasks on dynamic graphs such as node classification, link prediction and graph regression. However, few work has studied the temporal edge regression task which has important real-world applications. In this paper, we explore the application of GNNs to edge regression tasks in both static and dynamic settings, focusing on predicting food and agriculture trade values between nations. We introduce three simple yet strong baselines and comprehensively evaluate one static and three dynamic GNN models using the UN Trade dataset. Our experimental results reveal that the baselines exhibit remarkably strong performance across various settings, highlighting the inadequacy of existing GNNs. We also find that TGN outperforms other GNN models, suggesting TGN is a more appropriate choice for edge regression tasks. Moreover, we note that the proportion of negative edges in the training samples significantly affects the test performance. The companion source code can be found at: https://",

Remote control technology, which leverages human intelligence and precise machine movements, ensures operator safety and boosts productivity. Recently, virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in remote control applications by overcoming single-view limitations and providing three-dimensional information, yet most studies have not focused on agricultural settings. Therefore, to bridge the gap, this study proposes a large-scale digital mapping and immersive human-machine teleoperation framework specifically designed for precision agriculture. In this research, a DJI unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized for data collection, and a novel video segmentation approach based on feature points was introduced. To accommodate the variability of complex textures, this method proposes an enhanced Structure from Motion (SfM) approach. It integrates the open Multiple View Geometry (OpenMVG) framework with Local Features from Transformers (LoFTR). The enhanced SfM produces a point cloud map, which is further processed through Multi-View Stereo (MVS) to generate a complete map model. For control, a closed-loop system utilizing TCP/IP for VR control and positioning of agricultural machinery was introduced. This system offers a fully visual-based method for immersive control, allowing operators to utilize VR technology for remote operations. The experimental results demonstrate that the user-friendly remote control method also showcases its advantages over traditional video streaming-based remote operations, providing operators with a more comprehensive and immersive experience and a higher level of situational awareness.\nLarge Language Models and Foundation Models in Smart Agriculture: Basics, Opportunities, and Challenges\t\"Jiajia Li, \n      \n      Mingle Xu, \n      \n      Lirong Xiang, \n      \n      Dong Chen, \n      \n      Weichao Zhuang, \n      \n      Xunyuan Yin, \n      \n      Zhaojian Li\"\t2024/03/17\tThe past decade has witnessed the rapid development and adoption of ML & DL methodologies in agricultural systems, showcased by great successes in agricultural applications. However, these conventional ML/DL models have certain limitations: they heavily rely on large, costly-to-acquire labeled datasets for training, require specialized expertise for development and maintenance, and are mostly tailored for specific tasks, thus lacking generalizability. Recently, large pre-trained models, also known as FMs, have demonstrated remarkable successes in language, vision, and decision-making tasks across various domains. These models are trained on a large amount of data from multiple domains and modalities. Once trained, they can accomplish versatile tasks with just minor fine-tuning and minimal task-specific labeled data. Despite their proven effectiveness and huge potential, there has been little exploration of applying FMs to agriculture AI. Thus, this study aims to explore the potential of FMs in the field of smart agriculture. In particular, conceptual tools and technical background are presented to help the understanding of the problem space and uncover new research directions. To this end, recent FMs in the general CS domain are reviewed, and the models are categorized into four categories: language FMs, vision FMs, multimodal FMs, and reinforcement learning FMs. Then, the steps of developing agriculture FMs (AFMs) are outlined and potential applications in smart agriculture are discussed. Moreover, challenges and risks associated with developing AFMs are discussed, including model training, validation, and deployment. In summary, the advancement of AI in agriculture is explored by introducing AFMs as a promising paradigm that can significantly mitigate the reliance on extensive labeled datasets and enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization of agricultural AI systems.\nA Fog-based Smart Agriculture System to Detect Animal Intrusion\t\"Jinpeng Miao, \n      \n      Dasari Rajasekhar, \n      \n      Shivakant Mishra, \n      \n      Sanjeet Kumar Nayak, \n      \n      Ramanarayan Yadav\"\t2023/08/12\tSmart agriculture is one of the most promising areas where IoT-enabled technologies have the potential to substantially improve the quality and quantity of the crops and reduce the associated operational cost. However, building a smart agriculture system presents several challenges, including high latency and bandwidth consumption associated with cloud computing, frequent Internet disconnections in rural areas, and the need to keep costs low for farmers. This paper presents an end-to-end, fog-based smart agriculture infrastructure that incorporates edge computing and LoRa-based communication to address these challenges. Our system is deployed to transform traditional agriculture land of rural areas into smart agriculture. We address the top concern of farmers - animals intruding - by proposing a solution that detects animal intrusion using low-cost PIR sensors, cameras, and computer vision.

Drones and rovers are helping to realize precision agriculture and farmers with improved monitoring and surveying at affordable costs. Major benefits have come for vertical farming and fields with irrigation canals. However, drones have a limitation of flight time due to payload constraints. Rovers have limitations in vertical farming and obstacles like canals in agricultural fields. To meet the different requirements of multiple terrains and vertical farming in agriculture, we propose an autonomous hybrid drone-rover vehicle that combines the advantages of both rovers and drones. The prototype is described along with experimental results regarding its ability to avoid obstacles, pluck weeds and spray pesticides.\nTransforming U.S. agriculture with crushed rock for CO2_2 sequestration and increased production\t\"David J.

Banwart\"\t2023/08/08\tEnhanced weathering (EW) is a promising modification to current agricultural practices that uses crushed silicate rocks to drive carbon dioxide removal (CDR). If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero or negative emissions by 2050. We report detailed state-level analysis indicating EW deployed on agricultural land could sequester 0.23-0.38 Gt CO2_2 yr−1^{-1} and meet 36-60 % of U.S. technological CDR goals. Average CDR costs vary between state, being highest in the first decades before declining to a range of ∼$\\sim\\$100-150 tCO2−1_2{}^{-1} by 2050, including for three states (Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana) that contribute most to total national CDR. We identify multiple electoral swing states as being essential for scaling EW that are also key beneficiaries of the practice, indicating the need for strong bipartisan support of this technology. Assessment the geochemical capacity of rivers and oceans to carry dissolved EW products from soil drainage suggests EW provides secure long-term CO2_2 removal on intergenerational time scales. We additionally forecast mitigation of ground-level ozone increases expected with future climate change, as an indirect benefit of EW, and consequent avoidance of yield reductions. Our assessment supports EW as a practical innovation for leveraging agriculture to enable positive action on climate change with adherence to federal environmental justice priorities. However, implementing a stage-gating framework as upscaling proceeds to safeguard against environmental and biodiversity concerns will be essential.\nEmbedding-based Retrieval with LLM for Effective Agriculture Information Extracting from Unstructured Data\t\"Ruoling Peng, \n      \n      Kang Liu, \n      \n      Po Yang, \n      \n      Zhipeng Yuan, \n      \n      Shunbao Li\"\t2023/08/06\tPest identification is a crucial aspect of pest control in agriculture.

In this work, we explored using domain-agnostic general pre-trained large language model(LLM) to extract structured data from agricultural documents with minimal or no human intervention. We propose a methodology that involves text retrieval and filtering using embedding-based retrieval, followed by LLM question-answering to automatically extract entities and attributes from the documents, and transform them into structured data. In comparison to existing methods, our approach achieves consistently better accuracy in the benchmark while maintaining efficiency.\nChatbot Application to Support Smart Agriculture in Thailand\t\"Paweena Suebsombut, \n      \n      Pradorn Sureephong, \n      \n      Aicha Sekhari, \n      \n      Suepphong Chernbumroong, \n      \n      Abdelaziz Bouras\"\t2023/07/31\tA chatbot is a software developed to help reply to text or voice conversations automatically and quickly in real time.

To enhance this, the chatbot application can be an assistant to farmers to provide crop cultivation knowledge. Consequently, we propose the LINE chatbot application as an information and knowledge representation providing crop cultivation recommendations to farmers. It works with smart agriculture and recommendation systems. Our proposed LINE chatbot application consists of five main functions (start/stop menu, main page, drip irri gation page, mist irrigation page, and monitor page). Farmers will receive information for data monitoring to support their decision-making. Moreover, they can control the irrigation system via the LINE chatbot. Furthermore, farmers can ask questions relevant to the crop environment via a chat box. After implementing our proposed chatbot, farmers are very satisfied with the application, scoring a 96% satisfaction score. However, in terms of asking questions via chat box, this LINE chatbot application is a rule-based bot or script bot. Farmers have to type in the correct keywords as prescribed, otherwise they won't get a response from the chatbots. In the future, we will enhance the asking function of our LINE chatbot to be an intelligent bot.\nDeep Semantic Model Fusion for Ancient Agricultural Terrace Detection\t\"Yi Wang, \n      \n      Chenying Liu, \n      \n      Arti Tiwari, \n      \n      Micha Silver, \n      \n      Arnon Karnieli, \n      \n      Xiao Xiang Zhu, \n      \n      Conrad M Albrecht\"\t2023/08/04\tDiscovering ancient agricultural terraces in desert regions is important for the monitoring of long-term climate changes on the Earth's surface. However, traditional ground surveys are both costly and limited in scale. With the increasing accessibility of aerial and satellite data, machine learning techniques bear large potential for the automatic detection and recognition of archaeological landscapes. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic model fusion method for ancient agricultural terrace detection. The input data includes aerial images and LiDAR generated terrain features in the Negev desert. Two deep semantic segmentation models, namely DeepLabv3+ and UNet, with EfficientNet backbone, are trained and fused to provide segmentation maps of ancient terraces and walls. The proposed method won the first prize in the International AI Archaeology Challenge.

While motion planning for headland turning in open fields has been extensively studied and integrated into commercial auto-guidance systems, the existing methods primarily address scenarios with ample headland space and thus may not work in more constrained headland geometries. Commercial orchards often contain narrow and irregularly shaped headlands, which may include static obstacles,rendering the task of planning a smooth and collision-free turning trajectory difficult. To address this challenge, we propose an optimization-based motion planning algorithm for headland turning under geometrical constraints imposed by field geometry and obstacles.\nMultispectral Image Segmentation in Agriculture: A Comprehensive Study on Fusion Approaches\t\"Nuno Cunha, \n      \n      Tiago Barros, \n      \n      Mário Reis, \n      \n      Tiago Marta, \n      \n      Cristiano Premebida, \n      \n      Urbano J. Nunes\"\t2023/07/31\tMultispectral imagery is frequently incorporated into agricultural tasks, providing valuable support for applications such as image segmentation, crop monitoring, field robotics, and yield estimation. From an image segmentation perspective, multispectral cameras can provide rich spectral information, helping with noise reduction and feature extraction. As such, this paper concentrates on the use of fusion approaches to enhance the segmentation process in agricultural applications. More specifically, in this work, we compare different fusion approaches by combining RGB and NDVI as inputs for crop row detection, which can be useful in autonomous robots operating in the field. The inputs are used individually as well as combined at different times of the process (early and late fusion) to perform classical and DL-based semantic segmentation. In this study, two agriculture-related datasets are subjected to analysis using both deep learning (DL)-based and classical segmentation methodologies. The experiments reveal that classical segmentation methods, utilizing techniques such as edge detection and thresholding, can effectively compete with DL-based algorithms, particularly in tasks requiring precise foreground-background separation. This suggests that traditional methods retain their efficacy in certain specialized applications within the agricultural domain. Moreover, among the fusion strategies examined, late fusion emerges as the most robust approach, demonstrating superiority in adaptability and effectiveness across varying segmentation scenarios.

These distributors source a single product from a farmer through an agricultural cooperative, operating in a single period. The agents have the ability to coordinate their actions to maximize their profits, and we use cooperative game theory to analyze cooperation among them. The distributors can engage in joint ordering, increasing their order size, which leads to a decrease in the price per kilogram. Additionally, distributors have the opportunity to cooperate with the farmer, securing a reduced price per kilogram at the cost price, while compensating the farmer for any kilograms not acquired in the cooperation agreement. We introduce multidistributor-farmer games and we prove that all the agents have incentives to cooperate. We demonstrate the existence of stable allocations, where no subgroup of agents can be better off by separating. Moreover, we propose and characterize a distribution of the total profit that justly compensates the contribution of the farmer in any group of distributors. Finally, we explore the conditions under which the farmer can be compensated in order to maximize their revenues when cooperating with all players.\nAgricultural Robotic System: The Automation of Detection and Speech Control\t\"Yang Wenkai, \n      \n      Ji Ruihang, \n      \n      Yue Yiran, \n      \n      Gu Zhonghan, \n      \n      Shu Wanyang, \n      \n      Sam Ge Shuzhi\"\t2023/07/19\tAgriculture industries often face challenges in manual tasks such as planting, harvesting, fertilizing, and detection, which can be time consuming and prone to errors.

The vision detection module uses computer vision techniques, trained on YOLOv5 and deployed on the Jetson Nano in TensorRT format, to accurately detect and identify different items. A robotic arm module then precisely controls the picking up of seedlings or seeds, and arranges them in specific locations. The speech recognition module enhances intelligent human robot interaction, allowing for efficient and intuitive control of the system. This modular approach improves the efficiency and accuracy of agricultural tasks, demonstrating the potential of robotics in the agricultural industry.\nData sharing and ontology use among agricultural genetics, genomics, and breeding databases and resources of the AgBioData Consortium\t\"Jennifer L.

Two AgBioData working groups, focused on Data Sharing and Ontologies, conducted a survey to assess the status and future needs of the members in those areas. A total of 33 researchers responded to the survey, representing 37 databases. Results suggest that data sharing practices by AgBioData databases are in a healthy state, but it is not clear whether this is true for all metadata and data types across all databases; and that ontology use has not substantially changed since a similar survey was conducted in 2017. We recommend 1) providing training for database personnel in specific data sharing techniques, as well as in ontology use; 2) further study on what metadata is shared, and how well it is shared among databases; 3) promoting an understanding of data sharing and ontologies in the stakeholder community; 4) improving data sharing and ontologies for specific phenotypic data types and formats; and 5) lowering specific barriers to data sharing and ontology use, by identifying sustainability solutions, and the identification, promotion, or development of data standards. Combined, these improvements are likely to help AgBioData databases increase development efforts towards improved ontology use, and data sharing via programmatic means.\nGenerative AI in Agriculture: Creating Image Datasets Using DALL.E's Advanced Large Language Model Capabilities\t\"Ranjan Sapkota, \n      \n      Manoj Karkee\"\t2025/03/15\tThis research investigated the role of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the DALL.E model by OpenAI, in advancing data generation and visualization techniques in agriculture. DALL.E, an advanced AI image generator, works alongside ChatGPT's language processing to transform text descriptions and image clues into realistic visual representations of the content. The study used both approaches of image generation: text-to-image and image-to-image (variation). Six types of datasets depicting fruit crop environment were generated. These AI-generated images were then compared against ground truth images captured by sensors in real agricultural fields. The comparison was based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) metrics. The image-to-image generation exhibited a 5.78% increase in average PSNR over text-to-image methods, signifying superior image clarity and quality. However, this method also resulted in a 10.23% decrease in average FSIM, indicating a diminished structural and textural similarity to the original images. Similar to these measures, human evaluation also showed that images generated using image-to-image-based method were more realistic compared to those generated with text-to-image approach. The results highlighted DALL.E's potential in generating realistic agricultural image datasets and thus accelerating the development and adoption of imaging-based precision agricultural solutions. In future, DALL.E along with other alternative LLM based image generation models such as MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, Craiyon, Imagen, Parti, DreamStudio, Make-A-Scene, DeepDream, and VQ-GAN + CLIP could demonstrate further significant potential for enhancing image clarity, quality, and realism in depicting agricultural environments, which could revolutionize precision farming practices.\nEmploying Drones in Agriculture: An Exploration of Various Drone Types and Key Advantages\tE. C. Nunes\t2023/07/11\tThis article explores the use of drones in agriculture and discusses the various types of drones employed for different agricultural applications. Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer numerous advantages in farming practices. They provide real-time and high-resolution data collection, enabling farmers to make informed irrigation, fertilization, and pest management decisions. Drones assist in precision spraying and application of agricultural inputs, minimizing chemical wastage and optimizing resource utilization. They offer accessibility to inaccessible areas, reduce manual labor, and provide cost savings and increased operational efficiency. Drones also play a crucial role in mapping and surveying agricultural fields, aiding crop planning and resource allocation. However, challenges such as regulations and limited flight time need to be addressed. The advantages of using drones in agriculture include precision agriculture, cost and time savings, improved data collection and analysis, enhanced crop management, accessibility and flexibility, environmental sustainability, and increased safety for farmers. Overall, drones have the potential to revolutionize farming practices, leading to increased efficiency, productivity, and sustainability in agriculture.\nHow accurate are existing land cover maps for agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa?\t\"Hannah Kerner, \n      \n      Catherine Nakalembe, \n      \n      Adam Yang, \n      \n      Ivan Zvonkov, \n      \n      Ryan McWeeny, \n      \n      Gabriel Tseng, \n      \n      Inbal Becker-Reshef\"\t2024/06/02\tSatellite Earth observations (EO) can provide affordable and timely information for assessing crop conditions and food production. Such monitoring systems are essential in Africa, where there is high food insecurity and sparse agricultural statistics. EO-based monitoring systems require accurate cropland maps to provide information about croplands, but there is a lack of data to determine which of the many available land cover maps most accurately identify cropland in African countries. This study provides a quantitative evaluation and intercomparison of 11 publicly available land cover maps to assess their suitability for cropland classification and EO-based agriculture monitoring in Africa using statistically rigorous reference datasets from 8 countries. We hope the results of this study will help users determine the most suitable map for their needs and encourage future work to focus on resolving inconsistencies between maps and improving accuracy in low-accuracy regions.\nEnergy-Efficient Routing",

Clustering routing protocol plays an important role in reducing energy consumption and prolonging network lifetime. The cluster formation and cluster head selection are the key to improving the performance of the clustering routing protocol. An energy-efficient routing protocol based on multi-threshold segmentation (EERPMS) was proposed in this paper to improve the rationality of cluster formation and cluster head selection. In the stage of cluster formation, inspired by multi-threshold image segmentation, an innovative node clustering algorithm was developed. In the stage of cluster head selection, aiming at minimizing the network energy consumption, a calculation theory of the optimal number and location of cluster heads was established. Furthermore, a novel cluster head selection algorithm was constructed based on the residual energy and optimal location of cluster heads. Simulation results show that EERPMS can improve the distribution uniformity of cluster heads, prolong the network lifetime and save up to 64.50%, 58.60%, and 56.15% network energy as compared to RLEACH, CRPFCM, and FIGWO protocols respectively.\nConstrained Prioritized 3T2R Task Control for Robotic Agricultural Spraying\t\"Ivo Vatavuk, \n      \n      Zdenko Kovačić\"\t2023/07/01\tIn this paper, we present a solution for robot arm-controlled agricultural spraying, handling the spraying task as a constrained prioritized 3T2R task. 3T2R tasks in robot manipulation consist of three translational and two rotational degrees of freedom, and are frequently used when the end-effector is axis-symmetric. The solution presented in this paper introduces a prioritization between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the 3T2R task, and we discuss the utility of this kind of approach for both velocity and positional inverse kinematics, which relate to continuous and selective agricultural spraying applications respectively.\nEnergy Modelling and Forecasting for an Underground Agricultural Farm using a Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition Approach\t\"Zack Xuereb Conti, \n      \n      Rebecca Ward, \n      \n      Ruchi Choudhary\"\t2023/06/26\tThis paper presents an approach based on higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD) to model, analyse, and forecast energy behaviour in an urban agriculture farm situated in a retrofitted London underground tunnel, where observed measurements are influenced by noisy and occasionally transient conditions. HODMD is a data-driven reduced order modelling method typically used to analyse and predict highly noisy and complex flows in fluid dynamics or any type of complex data from dynamical systems. HODMD is a recent extension of the classical dynamic mode decomposition method (DMD), customised to handle scenarios where the spectral complexity underlying the measurement data is higher than its spatial complexity, such as is the environmental behaviour of the farm. HODMD decomposes temporal data as a linear expansion of physically-meaningful DMD-modes in a semi-automatic approach, using a time-delay embedded approach. We apply HODMD to three seasonal scenarios using real data measured by sensors located at at the cross-sectional centre of the the underground farm. Through the study we revealed three physically-interpretable mode pairs that govern the environmental behaviour at the centre of the farm, consistently across environmental scenarios. Subsequently, we demonstrate how we can reconstruct the fundamental structure of the observed time-series using only these modes, and forecast for three days ahead, as one, compact and interpretable reduced-order model. We find HODMD to serve as a robust, semi-automatic modelling alternative for predictive modelling in Digital Twins.\nSegmentation and Tracking of Vegetable Plants by Exploiting Vegetable Shape Feature for Precision Spray of Agricultural Robots\t\"Nan Hu, \n      \n      Daobilige Su, \n      \n      Shuo Wang, \n      \n      Xuechang Wang, \n      \n      Huiyu Zhong, \n      \n      Zimeng Wang, \n      \n      Yongliang Qiao, \n      \n      Yu Tan\"\t2023/06/26\tWith the increasing deployment of agricultural robots, the traditional manual spray of liquid fertilizer and pesticide is gradually being replaced by agricultural robots.

Regarding the robust tracking of vegetable plants, to solve the challenging problem of associating vegetables with similar color and texture in consecutive images, in this paper, a novel method of Multiple Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) is proposed for instance segmentation and tracking of multiple vegetable plants. In our approach, contour and blob features are extracted to describe unique feature of each individual vegetable, and associate the same vegetables in different images. By assigning a unique ID for each vegetable, it ensures the robot to spray each vegetable exactly once, while traversing along the farm rows.

In particular, we focus on the task of semantic matching, which involves establishing mappings between food descriptions and nutrition data. To accomplish this, we fine-tune a pre-trained transformer-based language model, AgriBERT, on this task, utilizing an external source of knowledge, such as the FoodOn ontology. To advance the field of agricultural NLP, we propose two new avenues of exploration: (1) utilizing GPT-based models as a baseline and (2) leveraging ChatGPT as an external source of knowledge. ChatGPT has shown to be a strong baseline in many NLP tasks, and we believe it has the potential to improve our model in the task of semantic matching and enhance our model's understanding of food-related concepts and relationships. Additionally, we experiment with other applications, such as cuisine prediction based on food ingredients, and expand the scope of our research to include other NLP tasks beyond semantic matching. Overall, this paper provides promising avenues for future research in this field, with potential implications for improving the performance of agricultural NLP applications.\nWeb of Things and Trends in Agriculture: A Systematic Literature Review\t\"Muhammad Shoaib Farooq, \n      \n      Shamyla Riaz, \n      \n      Atif Alvi\"\t2023/06/15\tIn the past few years, the Web of Things (WOT) became a beneficial game-changing technology within the Agriculture domain as it introduces innovative and promising solutions to the Internet of Things (IoT) agricultural applications problems by providing its services. WOT provides the support for integration, interoperability for heterogeneous devices, infrastructures, platforms, and the emergence of various other technologies. The main aim of this study is about understanding and providing a growing and existing research content, issues, and directions for the future regarding WOT-based agriculture. Therefore, a systematic literature review (SLR) of research articles is presented by categorizing the selected studies published between 2010 and 2020 into the following categories: research type, approaches, and their application domains.

The algorithm was tested on diverse headland areas with soil and vegetation. The proposed method could reach the end of the crop row and then navigate into the headland completely leaving behind the crop row with an error margin of 50 cm.\nPhenoBench -- A Large Dataset and Benchmarks for Semantic Image Interpretation in the Agricultural Domain\t\"Jan Weyler, \n      \n      Federico Magistri, \n      \n      Elias Marks, \n      \n      Yue Linn Chong, \n      \n      Matteo Sodano, \n      \n      Gianmarco Roggiolani, \n      \n      Nived Chebrolu, \n      \n      Cyrill Stachniss, \n      \n      Jens Behley\"\t2024/07/24\tThe production of food, feed, fiber, and fuel is a key task of agriculture, which has to cope with many challenges in the upcoming decades, e.g., a higher demand, climate change, lack of workers, and the availability of arable land.

Workers on H-2A visas are particularly vulnerable due to the precarity of their immigration status being tied to their employer. Although worksite inspections are one mechanism to detect such violations, many labor violations affecting agricultural workers go undetected due to limited inspection resources. In this study, we identify multiple state and industry level factors that correlate with H-2A violations identified by the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division using a multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial model. We find that three state-level factors (average farm acreage size, the number of agricultural establishments with less than 20 employees, and higher poverty rates) are correlated with H-2A violations. These findings provide guidance for inspection agencies regarding how to prioritize their limited resources to more effectively inspect agricultural workplaces, thereby improving workplace conditions for H-2A workers.\nThe Canadian Cropland Dataset: A New Land Cover Dataset for Multitemporal Deep Learning Classification in Agriculture\t\"Amanda A. Boatswain Jacques, \n      \n      Abdoulaye Baniré Diallo, \n      \n      Etienne Lord\"\t2023/06/04\tMonitoring land cover using remote sensing is vital for studying environmental changes and ensuring global food security through crop yield forecasting. Specifically, multitemporal remote sensing imagery provides relevant information about the dynamics of a scene, which has proven to lead to better land cover classification results. Nevertheless, few studies have benefited from high spatial and temporal resolution data due to the difficulty of accessing reliable, fine-grained and high-quality annotated samples to support their hypotheses. Therefore, we introduce a temporal patch-based dataset of Canadian croplands, enriched with labels retrieved from the Canadian Annual Crop Inventory. The dataset contains 78,536 manually verified high-resolution (10 m/pixel, 640 x 640 m) geo-referenced images from 10 crop classes collected over four crop production years (2017-2020) and five months (June-October). Each instance contains 12 spectral bands, an RGB image, and additional vegetation index bands. Individually, each category contains at least 4,800 images. Moreover, as a benchmark, we provide models and source code that allow a user to predict the crop class using a single image (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) or a sequence of images (LRCN, 3D-CNN) from the same location. In perspective, we expect this evolving dataset to propel the creation of robust agro-environmental models that can accelerate the comprehension of complex agricultural regions by providing accurate and continuous monitoring of land cover.\nChatAgri: Exploring Potentials of ChatGPT on Cross-linguistic Agricultural Text Classification\t\"Biao Zhao, \n      \n      Weiqiang Jin, \n      \n      Javier Del Ser, \n      \n      Guang Yang\"\t2023/05/24\tIn the era of sustainable smart agriculture, a massive amount of agricultural news text is being posted on the Internet, in which massive agricultural knowledge has been accumulated. In this context, it is urgent to explore effective text classification techniques for users to access the required agricultural knowledge with high efficiency. Mainstream deep learning approaches employing fine-tuning strategies on pre-trained language models (PLMs), have demonstrated remarkable performance gains over the past few years. Nonetheless, these methods still face many drawbacks that are complex to solve, including: 1. Limited agricultural training data due to the expensive-cost and labour-intensive annotation; 2. Poor domain transferability, especially of cross-linguistic ability; 3.

Despite tremendous progresses, one downside of such ML/DL models is that they generally rely on large-scale labeled datasets for training, and the performance of such models is strongly influenced by the size and quality of available labeled data samples. In addition, collecting, processing, and labeling such large-scale datasets is extremely costly and time-consuming, partially due to the rising cost in human labor. Therefore, developing label-efficient ML/DL methods for agricultural applications has received significant interests among researchers and practitioners. In fact, there are more than 50 papers on developing and applying deep-learning-based label-efficient techniques to address various agricultural problems since 2016, which motivates the authors to provide a timely and comprehensive review of recent label-efficient ML/DL methods in agricultural applications. To this end, we first develop a principled taxonomy to organize these methods according to the degree of supervision, including weak supervision (i.e., active learning and semi-/weakly- supervised learning), and no supervision (i.e., un-/self- supervised learning), supplemented by representative state-of-the-art label-efficient ML/DL methods. In addition, a systematic review of various agricultural applications exploiting these label-efficient algorithms, such as precision agriculture, plant phenotyping, and postharvest quality assessment, is presented. Finally, we discuss the current problems and challenges, as well as future research directions.

The article investigated the problems faced by Czech agricultural producers on the way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The author analyzed the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions by various branches of agriculture for the period 2000-2015. The author proposed the coefficient t -covariances to determine the interdependence of the given tabular macroeconomic values. This indicator allows you to analyze the interdependence of macroeconomic variables that do not have a normal distribution. In the context of the globalization of the economy and the need to combat global warming in each country, it makes sense to produce primarily agricultural products that provide maximum added value with maximum greenhouse gas emissions.\nCWD30: A Comprehensive and Holistic Dataset for Crop Weed Recognition in Precision Agriculture\t\"Talha Ilyas, \n      \n      Dewa Made Sri Arsa, \n      \n      Khubaib Ahmad, \n      \n      Yong Chae Jeong, \n      \n      Okjae Won, \n      \n      Jong Hoon Lee, \n      \n      Hyongsuk Kim\"\t2023/05/17\tThe growing demand for precision agriculture necessitates efficient and accurate crop-weed recognition and classification systems. Current datasets often lack the sample size, diversity, and hierarchical structure needed to develop robust deep learning models for discriminating crops and weeds in agricultural fields. Moreover, the similar external structure and phenomics of crops and weeds complicate recognition tasks. To address these issues, we present the CWD30 dataset, a large-scale, diverse, holistic, and hierarchical dataset tailored for crop-weed recognition tasks in precision agriculture. CWD30 comprises over 219,770 high-resolution images of 20 weed species and 10 crop species, encompassing various growth stages, multiple viewing angles, and environmental conditions. The images were collected from diverse agricultural fields across different geographic locations and seasons, ensuring a representative dataset. The dataset's hierarchical taxonomy enables fine-grained classification and facilitates the development of more accurate, robust, and generalizable deep learning models. We conduct extensive baseline experiments to validate the efficacy of the CWD30 dataset. Our experiments reveal that the dataset poses significant challenges due to intra-class variations, inter-class similarities, and data imbalance. Additionally, we demonstrate that minor training modifications like using CWD30 pretrained backbones can significantly enhance model performance and reduce convergence time, saving training resources on several downstream tasks. These challenges provide valuable insights and opportunities for future research in crop-weed recognition. We believe that the CWD30 dataset will serve as a benchmark for evaluating crop-weed recognition algorithms, promoting advancements in precision agriculture, and fostering collaboration among researchers in the field.\nTowards a methodology to consider the environmental impacts of digital agriculture\tPierre La Rocca\t2024/09/11\tAgriculture affects global warming, while its yields are threatened by it.

Most of the existing methods use a backbone to extract initial features with independent branches for each task, and the exchange of information between the branches usually occurs through the concatenation or sum of the feature maps of the branches. However, this type of information exchange does not directly consider the local characteristics of the image nor the level of importance or correlation between the tasks. In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method, MTLSegFormer, which combines multi-task learning and attention mechanisms. After the backbone feature extraction, two feature maps are learned for each task. The first map is proposed to learn features related to its task, while the second map is obtained by applying learned visual attention to locally re-weigh the feature maps of the other tasks. In this way, weights are assigned to local regions of the image of other tasks that have greater importance for the specific task. Finally, the two maps are combined and used to solve a task. We tested the performance in two challenging problems with correlated tasks and observed a significant improvement in accuracy, mainly in tasks with high dependence on the others.\nUsing interpretable boosting algorithms for modeling environmental and agricultural data\t\"Fabian Obster, \n      \n      Christian Heumann, \n      \n      Heidi Bohle, \n      \n      Paul Pechan\"\t2023/05/04\tWe describe how interpretable boosting algorithms based on ridge-regularized generalized linear models can be used to analyze high-dimensional environmental data.

We show how group structures can be considered and how interactions can be found in high-dimensional datasets using a novel 2-step boosting approach. The advantages and efficacy of the proposed method are shown and discussed. Results indicate that the presence of interaction effects only improves predictive power when included in two-step boosting. The most important variable in predicting all types of vulnerabilities are natural assets. Other important variables are the type of irrigation, economic assets and the presence of crop damage of near farms.\nHeterogeneous GNN-RL Based Task Offloading for UAV-aided Smart Agriculture\t\"Turgay Pamuklu, \n      \n      Aisha Syed, \n      \n      W.

Moreover, the proposed solution has increased robustness to network topology changes and is able to adapt to extreme cases, such as the failure of a UAV.\nAgricultural Policy in Ukraine\t\"Oleg Nivievskyi, \n      \n      Pavlo Martyshev, \n      \n      Sergiy Kvasha\"\t2023/04/29\tBuilding upon the theory and methodology of agricultural policy developed in the previous chapter, in Chapter 2 we analyse and assess agricultural policy making in Ukraine since the breakup of Soviet Union till today. Going from top down to the bottom, we begin by describing the evolution of state policy in the agri-food sector. In the beginning, we describe the major milestones of agricultural policy making since independence, paving the way to the political economy of the modern agricultural policy in Ukraine. Then we describe the role of agri-food sector in the national economy as well as globally in ensuring food security in the world. After, we dig deeper and focus on a detailed performance of agricultural sector by looking at farm structures, their land use, overall and sector-wise untapped productivity potential. Modern agricultural policy and institutional set-up is contained and analyzed in details in the section 2.4.

Using monthly data from 2010 to 2023 on over 86,000 incidents covering 376 one-degree cells across eight Southeast Asian countries, we estimate a general increase in political violence and a decrease in social unrest in croplands with rice production during the harvest season relative to the rest of the crop year. In a finding that is least sensitive to alternative model specifications and data subsetting, we estimate a nine percent increase in violence against civilians in locations with considerable rice production compared to other parts of the region during the harvest season, relative to the rest of the year. We show that the harvest-time changes in conflict are most evident in rural cells with rainfed agriculture. Using location-specific annual variation in growing season rainfall, we then show that the harvest-time increase in violence against civilians occurs in presumably good harvest years, whereas increase in battles between actors of political violence follows growing seasons with scarce rainfall. The harvest-time decrease in social unrest, protests in particular, occurs after presumably bad harvest years. These findings contribute to research on the agroclimatic and economic roots of conflict and offer insights to policymakers by suggesting the spatiotemporal concentration of conflict as well as diverging effects by forms of conflict at harvest time in the rice-producing regions of Southeast Asia.\nAn innovative Deep Learning Based Approach for Accurate Agricultural Crop Price Prediction\t\"Mayank Ratan Bhardwaj, \n      \n      Jaydeep Pawar, \n      \n      Abhijnya Bhat, \n      \n       Deepanshu, \n      \n      Inavamsi Enaganti, \n      \n      Kartik Sagar, \n      \n      Y. Narahari\"\t2023/04/15\tAccurate prediction of agricultural crop prices is a crucial input for decision-making by various stakeholders in agriculture: farmers, consumers, retailers, wholesalers, and the Government. These decisions have significant implications including, most importantly, the economic well-being of the farmers. In this paper, our objective is to accurately predict crop prices using historical price information, climate conditions, soil type, location, and other key determinants of crop prices. This is a technically challenging problem, which has been attempted before. In this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning based approach to achieve increased accuracy in price prediction. The proposed approach uses graph neural networks (GNNs) in conjunction with a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) model to exploit geospatial dependencies in prices. Our approach works well with noisy legacy data and produces a performance that is at least 20% better than the results available in the literature. We are able to predict prices up to 30 days ahead. We choose two vegetables, potato (stable price behavior) and tomato (volatile price behavior) and work with noisy public data available from Indian agricultural markets.\nDesigning Fair, Cost-optimal Auctions based on Deep Learning for Procuring Agricultural Inputs through Farmer Collectives\t\"Mayank Ratan Bhardwaj, \n      \n      Bazil Ahmed, \n      \n      Prathik Diwakar, \n      \n      Ganesh Ghalme, \n      \n      Y. Narahari\"\t2023/04/14\tProcuring agricultural inputs (agri-inputs for short) such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, at desired quality levels and at affordable cost, forms a critical component of agricultural input operations. This is a particularly challenging problem being faced by small and marginal farmers in any emerging economy. Farmer collectives (FCs), which are cooperative societies of farmers, offer an excellent prospect for enabling cost-effective procurement of inputs with assured quality to the farmers. In this paper, our objective is to design sound, explainable mechanisms by which an FC will be able to procure agri-inputs in bulk and distribute the inputs procured to the individual farmers who are members of the FC. In the methodology proposed here, an FC engages qualified suppliers in a competitive, volume discount procurement auction in which the suppliers specify price discounts based on volumes supplied. The desiderata of properties for such an auction include: minimization of the total cost of procurement; incentive compatibility; individual rationality; fairness; and other business constraints. An auction satisfying all these properties is analytically infeasible and a key contribution of this paper is to develop a deep learning based approach to design such an auction. We use two realistic, stylized case studies from chili seeds procurement and a popular pesticide procurement to demonstrate the efficacy of these auctions.\nAGI for Agriculture\t\"Guoyu Lu, \n      \n      Sheng Li, \n      \n      Gengchen Mai, \n      \n      Jin Sun, \n      \n      Dajiang Zhu, \n      \n      Lilong Chai, \n      \n      Haijian Sun, \n      \n      Xianqiao Wang, \n      \n      Haixing Dai, \n      \n      Ninghao Liu, \n      \n      Rui",

Within healthcare, AGI is being utilized to analyze clinical medical notes, recognize patterns in patient data, and aid in patient management. Agriculture is another critical sector that impacts the lives of individuals worldwide. It serves as a foundation for providing food, fiber, and fuel, yet faces several challenges, such as climate change, soil degradation, water scarcity, and food security. AGI has the potential to tackle these issues by enhancing crop yields, reducing waste, and promoting sustainable farming practices. It can also help farmers make informed decisions by leveraging real-time data, leading to more efficient and effective farm management. This paper delves into the potential future applications of AGI in agriculture, such as agriculture image processing, natural language processing (NLP), robotics, knowledge graphs, and infrastructure, and their impact on precision livestock and precision crops. By leveraging the power of AGI, these emerging technologies can provide farmers with actionable insights, allowing for optimized decision-making and increased productivity. The transformative potential of AGI in agriculture is vast, and this paper aims to highlight its potential to revolutionize the industry.\nAgronav: Autonomous Navigation Framework for Agricultural Robots and Vehicles using Semantic Segmentation and Semantic Line Detection\t\"Shivam K Panda, \n      \n      Yongkyu Lee, \n      \n      M. Khalid Jawed\"\t2023/04/09\tThe successful implementation of vision-based navigation in agricultural fields hinges upon two critical components: 1) the accurate identification of key components within the scene, and 2) the identification of lanes through the detection of boundary lines that separate the crops from the traversable ground. We propose Agronav, an end-to-end vision-based autonomous navigation framework, which outputs the centerline from the input image by sequentially processing it through semantic segmentation and semantic line detection models. We also present Agroscapes, a pixel-level annotated dataset collected across six different crops, captured from varying heights and angles. This ensures that the framework trained on Agroscapes is generalizable across both ground and aerial robotic platforms. Codes, models and dataset will be released at \\href{https://github.com/shivamkumarpanda/agronav}{github.com/shivamkumarpanda/agronav}.\nINoD: Injected Noise Discriminator for Self-Supervised Representation Learning in Agricultural Fields\t\"Julia Hindel, \n      \n      Nikhil Gosala, \n      \n      Kevin Bregler, \n      \n      Abhinav Valada\"\t2023/06/19\tPerception datasets for agriculture are limited both in quantity and diversity which hinders effective training of supervised learning approaches. Self-supervised learning techniques alleviate this problem, however, existing methods are not optimized for dense prediction tasks in agriculture domains which results in degraded performance. In this work, we address this limitation with our proposed Injected Noise Discriminator (INoD) which exploits principles of feature replacement and dataset discrimination for self-supervised representation learning. INoD interleaves feature maps from two disjoint datasets during their convolutional encoding and predicts the dataset affiliation of the resultant feature map as a pretext task. Our approach enables the network to learn unequivocal representations of objects seen in one dataset while observing them in conjunction with similar features from the disjoint dataset. This allows the network to reason about higher-level semantics of the entailed objects, thus improving its performance on various downstream tasks. Additionally, we introduce the novel Fraunhofer Potato 2022 dataset consisting of over 16,800 images for object detection in potato fields. Extensive evaluations of our proposed INoD pretraining strategy for the tasks of object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation on the Sugar Beets 2016 and our potato dataset demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nTowards Optimal Energy-Water Supply System Operation for Agricultural and Metropolitan Ecosystems\t\"M.

To tackle this challenge efficiently and sustainably, the interdependence of these interconnected resources has to be considered. In this work, we present a holistic decision-making framework which takes into account simultaneously a water and energy supply system with the capability of satisfying metropolitan and agricultural resource demands. The framework features: (i) a generic large-scale planning and scheduling optimization model to minimize the annualized cost of the design and operation of the energy-water supply system, (ii) a mixed-integer linear optimization formulation, which relies on the development of surrogate models based on feedforward artificial neural networks and first-order Taylor expansions, and (iii) constraints for land and water utilization enabling multi-objective optimization. The framework provides the operational profiles of all energy-water system elements over a given time horizon, which uncover potential synergies between the essential food, energy, and water resource supply systems.\nPixel-wise Agricultural Image Time Series Classification: Comparisons and a Deformable Prototype-based Approach\t\"Elliot Vincent, \n      \n      Jean Ponce, \n      \n      Mathieu Aubry\"\t2024/07/12",

Leveraging this data for agricultural monitoring is key for addressing environmental and economic challenges. Current methods for crop segmentation using temporal data either rely on annotated data or are heavily engineered to compensate the lack of supervision. In this paper, we present and compare datasets and methods for both supervised and unsupervised pixel-wise segmentation of satellite image time series (SITS). We also introduce an approach to add invariance to spectral deformations and temporal shifts to classical prototype-based methods such as K-means and Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC). We study different levels of supervision and show this simple and highly interpretable method achieves the best performance in the low data regime and significantly improves the state of the art for unsupervised classification of agricultural time series on four recent SITS datasets.\nOn Domain-Specific Pre-Training for Effective Semantic Perception in Agricultural Robotics\t\"Gianmarco Roggiolani, \n      \n      Federico Magistri, \n      \n      Tiziano Guadagnino, \n      \n      Jan Weyler, \n      \n      Giorgio Grisetti, \n      \n      Cyrill Stachniss, \n      \n      Jens Behley\"\t2023/03/22\tAgricultural robots have the prospect to enable more efficient and sustainable agricultural production of food, feed, and fiber. Perception of crops and weeds is a central component of agricultural robots that aim to monitor fields and assess the plants as well as their growth stage in an automatic manner. Semantic perception mostly relies on deep learning using supervised approaches, which require time and qualified workers to label fairly large amounts of data. In this paper, we look into the problem of reducing the amount of labels without compromising the final segmentation performance. For robots operating in the field, pre-training networks in a supervised way is already a popular method to reduce the number of required labeled images. We investigate the possibility of pre-training in a self-supervised fashion using data from the target domain. To better exploit this data, we propose a set of domain-specific augmentation strategies. We evaluate our pre-training on semantic segmentation and leaf instance segmentation, two important tasks in our domain. The experimental results suggest that pre-training with domain-specific data paired with our data augmentation strategy leads to superior performance compared to commonly used pre-trainings. Furthermore, the pre-trained networks obtain similar performance to the fully supervised with less labeled data.\nTail dependence structure and extreme risk spillover effects between the international agricultural futures and spot markets\t\"Yun-Shi Dai, \n      \n      Peng-Fei Dai, \n      \n      Wei-Xing Zhou\"\t2023/03/20\tThis paper combines the Copula-CoVaR approach with the ARMA-GARCH-skewed Student-t model to investigate the tail dependence structure and extreme risk spillover effects between the international agricultural futures and spot markets, taking four main agricultural commodities, namely soybean, maize, wheat, and rice as examples. The empirical results indicate that the tail dependence structures for the four futures-spot pairs are quite different, and each of them exhibits a certain degree of asymmetry. In addition, the futures market for each agricultural commodity has significant and robust extreme downside and upside risk spillover effects on the spot market, and the downside risk spillover effects for both soybeans and maize are significantly stronger than their corresponding upside risk spillover effects, while there is no significant strength difference between the two risk spillover effects for wheat, and rice. This study provides a theoretical basis for strengthening global food cooperation and maintaining global food security, and has practical significance for investors to use agricultural commodities for risk management and portfolio optimization.\nPanoptic One-Click Segmentation: Applied to Agricultural Data\t\"Patrick Zimmer, \n      \n      Michael Halstead, \n      \n      Chris McCool\"\t2023/03/15\tIn weed control, precision agriculture can help to greatly reduce the use of herbicides, resulting in both economical and ecological benefits. A key element is the ability to locate and segment all the plants from image data. Modern instance segmentation techniques can achieve this, however, training such systems requires large amounts of hand-labelled data which is expensive and laborious to obtain. Weakly supervised training can help to greatly reduce labelling efforts and costs. We propose panoptic one-click segmentation, an efficient and accurate offline tool to produce pseudo-labels from click inputs which reduces labelling effort. Our approach jointly estimates the pixel-wise location of all N objects in the scene, compared to traditional approaches which iterate independently through all N objects; this greatly reduces training time. Using just 10% of the data to train our panoptic one-click segmentation approach yields 68.1% and 68.8% mean object intersection over union (IoU) on challenging sugar beet and corn image data respectively, providing comparable performance to traditional one-click approaches while being approximately 12 times faster to train. We demonstrate the applicability of our system by generating pseudo-labels from clicks on the remaining 90% of the data. These pseudo-labels are then used to train Mask R-CNN, in a semi-supervised manner, improving the absolute performance (of mean foreground IoU) by 9.4 and 7.9 points for sugar beet and corn data respectively. Finally, we show that our technique can recover missed clicks during annotation outlining a further benefit over traditional approaches.\nDAVIS-Ag: A Synthetic Plant Dataset for Prototyping Domain-In",

Although recent studies on active vision have shown some potential for agricultural tasks, each model has been designed and validated on a unique environment that would not easily be replicated for benchmarking novel methods being developed later. In this paper, we introduce a dataset, so-called DAVIS-Ag, for promoting more extensive research on Domain-inspired Active VISion in Agriculture. To be specific, we leveraged our open-source \"AgML\" framework and 3D plant simulator of \"Helios\" to produce 502K RGB images from 30K densely sampled spatial locations in 632 synthetic orchards. Moreover, plant environments of strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes are considered at two different scales (i.e., Single-Plant and Multi-Plant). Useful labels are also provided for each image, including (1) bounding boxes and (2) instance segmentation masks for all identifiable fruits, and also (3) pointers to other images of the viewpoints that are reachable by an execution of action so as to simulate active viewpoint selections at each time step. Using DAVIS-Ag, we visualize motivating examples where fruit visibility can dramatically change depending on the pose of the camera view primarily due to occlusions by other components, such as leaves. Furthermore, we present several baseline models with experiment results for benchmarking in the task of target visibility maximization. Transferability to real strawberry environments is also investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of using the dataset for prototyping real-world solutions. For future research, our dataset is made publicly available online: https://github.com/ctyeong/DAVIS-Ag.\nDeep-Learning-based Counting Methods, Datasets, and Applications in Agriculture -- A Review\t\"Guy Farjon, \n      \n      Liu Huijun, \n      \n      Yael Edan\"\t2023/05/09\tThe number of objects is considered an important factor in a variety of tasks in the agricultural domain.

This is particularly true for semantic segmentation tasks, which are much less common in the remote sensing domain because of the incredible difficulty in collecting precise, accurate, pixel-level annotations at scale. Recent efforts have addressed these challenges both through the creation of supervised datasets as well as the application of self-supervised methods. We continue these efforts on both fronts. First, we generate and release an improved version of the Agriculture-Vision dataset (Chiu et al., 2020b) to include raw, full-field imagery for greater experimental flexibility. Second, we extend this dataset with the release of 3600 large, high-resolution (10cm/pixel), full-field, red-green-blue and near-infrared images for pre-training. Third, we incorporate the Pixel-to-Propagation Module Xie et al. (2021b) originally built on the SimCLR framework into the framework of MoCo-V2 Chen et al.(2020b). Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this data by benchmarking different contrastive learning approaches on both downstream classification and semantic segmentation tasks. We explore both CNN and Swin Transformer Liu et al. (2021a) architectures within different frameworks based on MoCo-V2. Together, these approaches enable us to better detect key agricultural patterns of interest across a field from aerial imagery so that farmers may be alerted to problematic areas in a timely fashion to inform their management decisions. Furthermore, the release of these datasets will support numerous avenues of research for computer vision in remote sensing for agriculture.\nSpatiotemporal characteristics of agricultural food import shocks\t\"Yin-Ting Zhang, \n      \n      Duc Khuong Nguyen, \n      \n      Wei-Xing Zhou\"\t2023/03/01",

Food import shocks have significant impacts on targeted economies. Using import trade data of four staple crops (maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) from 1986 to 2018, this paper identifies food import trade shocks that occurred to economies during the period of 1995--2018. We compare the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of import shocks occurring to different crops and analyze the shock intensity and shock recovery in various continents based on locally weighted polynomial regression and Cook's distance. The results reveal higher frequencies during the 2007/2008 food crisis and relatively higher shock frequencies in North America, Africa, and Asia. Meanwhile, there are regional differences in shock recovery, with the majority of shocks in Asia recovering in the short term. We also find that high import diversity and a low import dependency ratio buffer economies against import shocks, resulting in a low shock rate and a high recovery rate. These results contribute to our understanding of the external supply risks of food, placing emphasis on accessibility issues in food security.\nInsight into China's Economically Motivated Adulteration Risk in Online Raw Agricultural Product Sales\t\"Hengyu Liu, \n      \n      Wen Tong\"\t2023/02/19\tUncertainty in quality and the inspectors' imperfect testing capability leave raw agricultural products (e.g., fresh produce, seafood, livestock and poultry products, etc.) wide open to economically motivated adulteration (EMA), and the strong demand for online shopping of these products in China makes this situation even worse. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic framework to investigate online raw agricultural product sellers' preemptive EMA behavior on an ecommerce platform (EP). Particularly, the sellers differ from each other in the original quality of their products. We characterize the sellers' equilibrium pricing and adulteration decisions and the EP's optimal take rate decision, and analyze how the sampling inspections and adulteration penalty jointly impact these decisions. Moreover, we investigate three managerial levers, such as claiming a higher-than-law-requires penalty, that the administrative departments or the EP can use to deter EMA. Finally, we use the real-word data from Taobao.com to calibrate our model and derive more managerial insights from the analytical findings. We find that the heterogenous sellers' adulteration decisions are symmetric and their ex-post pricing decisions lead them to evenly share the market on the EP. Interestingly, we show that the EP's higher take rate will inhibit the sellers' adulteration behavior. However, the profit-maximizing EP may indulge the sellers' adulteration behavior by intentionally decreasing this rate. Our results highlight a penalty-inspection-centered approach as essential to combat EMA, and the three levels can play a role as supplements to this approach under certain conditions.\nSubsidizing agricultural inputs in Senegal: Comparative analysis of three modes of intervention using a farm household model\t\"Aymeric Ricome, \n      \n      Kamel Louhichi, \n      \n      Sergio Gomez y Paloma\"\t2023/02/02\tThis report presents the results of an ex-ante impact assessment of several scenarios related to the farmer targeting of the input subsidy programme currently implemented in Senegal.

The impacts on crop mix, fertilizer application, farm income and on the government cost are presented and discussed.\nStudy of the chemical composition of fluoroalkylamines used in agriculture and medicine in the field of plasma incineration between 500 K and 20,000 K\t\"Pafadnam Ibrahim, \n      \n      Nièssan Kohio, \n      \n      Wêpari Charles Yaguibou, \n      \n      Abdoul Karim Kagoné, \n      \n      Zacharie Koalaga, \n      \n      Pascal André\"\t2023/02/13\tActive ingredients containing fluorinated organic compounds such as Fluoroalkylamines or pyrimidine-based molecules are promising in the field of agriculture (pesticides and herbicides) and pharmacology (antibiotics). The massive use of these molecules will result in a massive increase in waste containing this type of molecule. Developed countries have restrictive waste management policies, which is not the case in developing countries. In the latter, we are witnessing a proliferation of storage areas and open-air disposal of waste, sometimes from developed countries. These practices have enormous consequences on the environment such as air, soil and water pollution and therefore on human health. One of the solutions already proven on solid waste would be the use of plasma torches. These torches can reach high temperatures (5,000 K to 20,000 K). However, the use of these means of treatment is not without danger since toxic or lethal molecules could be produced. In order to understand these difficulties, we propose to study the influence of air on the chemical composition of a plasma based on fluoroalkylamines (trifluoroethylamine: C2H4F3N, nonafluoropentylamine: C5H4F9N, etc.), at atmospheric pressure and at atmospheric pressure. local thermodynamic equilibrium (E.T.L), in a temperature range from 500 K to 20,000 K.

However, while climatic data is generally available to help provide much of that understanding, it can often be in a form not easy to digest. The proposed Combined Location Online Weather Data (CLOWD) framework is an easy-to-use online platform for analysing recent and historical weather data of any location within Australia at the click of a map. CLOWD requires no programming skills and operates in any HTML5 web browser on PC and mobile devices. It enables comparison between current and previous growing seasons over a range of environmental parameters, and can create a plain-English PDF report for offline use, using natural language generation (NLG). This paper details the platform, the design decisions taken and outlines how farmers and growers can use CLOWD to better understand current growing conditions. Prototypes of CLOWD are now online for PCs and smartphones.\nHow a simple chloroplast psbA gene mutation changed world agriculture\tJack Dekker\t2023/02/07\tAtrazine as a weed control tactic profoundly changed world agriculture. Long-term use revealed resistant biotypes, R, with a single base pair mutation of the chloroplast psbA gene. The R phenotype emerged from a sequential cascade of pleiotropic effects from the plastid to the whole plant. This reorganization of the R biotype revealed photosynthetic regulation at different levels of plant organization. The environment affected R plant productivity differently than in the susceptible, S, biotype. A consistent, differential, pattern of photosynthesis was observed between R and S over the diurnal light period. Photosynthetic superiority of a biotype was a function of the time of day, plant age temperature. Under highly favorable environmental conditions S often had the advantage over R. Under less favorable, stressful, conditions R can be at an advantage over S. Pleiotropic reorganization revealed a sun-air-leaf Shannon communication system, providing insights into the complex interaction of chloroplast components in photosynthetic regulation. Altered plastid thylakoid and stomatal function regulate how the R leaf utilizes the sun-air environment. Movement of sun-air messages demonstrated how sunlight and air are modified to a usable message for carbon fixation. These insights showed how agriculture changed weed populations, and how resistant weed populations changed agriculture. These changes changed herbicide resistance: introduction of herbicide resistant crops, HRC. The development of HRCs extended the evolutionary reach of R weeds. R weed biotypes were naturally selected in these introduced HRCs: an evolutionary spiral of human technology extended the phenotypic reach of R biotypes.\nPlasma Agriculture: A green technology to attain the sustainable agriculture goal\t\"Tanvira Malek, \n      \n      Mangilal Choudhary\"\t2023/02/04\tThe agriculture sector has many issues such as reductions of agricultural lands, growing population, health issues arising due to the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, reduction in soil health due to extreme use of synthetic chemicals during farming, etc. The quality and quantity of foods required for living things are affected by many factors like scarcity of nutrient-rich soils, lack of suitable fertilizers, harmful insects and bugs, climate change, etc. There is a requirement to supply the proper nutrients to plants/crops for obtaining a high crop yield. Synthetic chemical fertilizers provide nutrients (macro and micro) to plants for their growth and development but the excess use of them is not good for a healthy lifestyle as well as for the environment. In recent years, non-thermal plasma (NTP) is considered as an advanced green technology for enhancing productivity in agriculture sectors. In this report, we provided the details of nutrients and their functions in the growth and development of plants/crops. How plasma technology can resolve many future challenges in the agriculture sector is discussed in detail. A few experiments on seed germination and plant growth (root and shoot length) were performed in the laboratory to explore the effect of plasma-activated water on the growth and development of plants. These primary results demonstrate the great potential of plasma technology in the agriculture sector.\nBibliometric and social network analysis on the use of satellite imagery in agriculture: an entropy-based approach\t\"Riccardo Dainelli, \n      \n      Fabio Saracco\"\t2023/02/17\tSatellite imagery is gaining popularity as a valuable tool to lower the impact on natural resources and increase profits for farmers.

For the academic literature, different performances of various countries were observed: the USA and China resulted as the leading actors, both in terms of published papers and employed researchers. Among the categorised keywords, \"resolution\", \"Landsat\", \"yield\", \"wheat\" and \"multispectral\" are the most used. Then, analysing the semantic network of the words used in the various abstracts, the different facets of the research in satellite remote sensing were detected. The importance of retrieving meteorological parameters through remote sensing and the broad use of vegetation indexes emerged from these analyses. As emerging topics, classification tasks for land use assessment and crop recognition stand out, alongside the use of hyperspectral sensors. Regarding the interaction of academia with the public, the analysis showed that it is practically absent on Twitter: most of the activity therein stems from private companies advertising their business. This shows that there is still a communication gap between academia and actors from other societal sectors.\nThe Role of Digital Agriculture in Transforming Rural Areas into Smart Villages\t\"Mohammad Raziuddin Chowdhury, \n      \n      Md Sakib Ullah Sourav, \n      \n      Rejwan Bin Sulaiman\"\t2023/01/07\tFrom the perspective of any nation, rural areas generally present a comparable set of problems, such as a lack of proper health care, education, living conditions, wages, and market opportunities. Some nations have created and developed the concept of smart villages during the previous few decades, which effectively addresses these issues. The landscape of traditional agriculture has been radically altered by digital agriculture, which has also had a positive economic impact on farmers and those who live in rural regions by ensuring an increase in agricultural production. We explored current issues in rural areas, and the consequences of smart village applications, and then illustrate our concept of smart village from recent examples of how emerging digital agriculture trends contribute to improving agricultural production in this chapter.\nUsing I4.0 digital twins in agriculture\t\"Rodrigo Falcão, \n      \n      Raghad Matar, \n      \n      Bernd Rauch\"\t2023/01/23\tAgriculture is a huge domain where an enormous landscape of systems interact to support agricultural processes, which are becoming increasingly digital. From the perspective of agricultural service providers, a prominent challenge is interoperability. In the Fraunhofer lighthouse project Cognitive Agriculture (COGNAC), we investigated how the usage of Industry 4.0 digital twins (I4.0 DTs) can help overcome this challenge. This paper contributes architecture drivers and a solution concept using I4.0 DTs in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities and limitations offered by I4.0 DTs for the agricultural domain.\nSugarChain: Blockchain technology meets Agriculture -- The case study and analysis of the Indian sugarcane farming\t\"Naresh Kshetri, \n      \n      Chandra Sekhar Bhusal, \n      \n      Dilip Kumar, \n      \n      Devendra Chapagain\"\t2023/01/19\tNot only in our country and Asia, but the agriculture sector is also lagging all over the world while using new technologies and innovations. Farmers are not getting the accurate price and compensation of their products because of several reasons. The intermediate persons or say middlemen are controlling the prices and product delivery on their own. Due to lack of education, technological advancement, market knowledge, post-harvesting processes, and middleman involvement, farmers are always deprived of their actual pay and efforts. The use of blockchain technology can help such farmers to automate the process with high trust. We have presented our case study and analysis for the Indian sugarcane farming with data collected from farmers. The system implementation, testing, and result analysis has been shown based on the case study. The overall purpose of our research is to emphasize and motivate the agricultural products and benefit the farmers with the use of blockchain technology.\nObservability and Identifiability Analyses of Process Models for Agricultural Anaerobic Digestion Plants\t\"Simon Hellmann, \n      \n      Arne-Jens Hempel, \n      \n      Stefan Streif, \n      \n      Sören Weinrich\"\t2023/04/05\tDynamic operation of anaerobic digestion plants requires advanced process monitoring and control. Different simplifications of the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) have been proposed recently, which appear promising for model-based process automation and state estimation. As a fundamental requirement, observability and identifiability of these models are analyzed in this work, which was pursued through algebraic and geometric analysis. Manual algebraic assessment was successfull for small models such as the ADM1-R4 and simplified versions of the ADM1-R3, which were derived in this context. However, for larger model classes the algebraic approach showed to be insufficient. By contrast, the geometric approach, implemented in the STRIKE_GOLDD toolbox, allowed to show observability for more complex models (including ADM1-R4 and ADM1-R3), employing two independent algorithms. The present study lays the groundwork for state observer design, parameter estimation and advanced control resting upon ADM1-based models.\n5G on the Farm: Evaluating Wireless Network Capabilities for Agricultural Robotics\t\"Tsvetan Zhivkov, \n      \n      Elizabeth I.

Sklar\"\t2022/12/09\tGlobal food security is an issue that is fast becoming a critical matter in the world today. Global warming, climate change and a range of other impacts caused by humans, such as carbon emissions, sociopolitical and economical challenges (e.g. war), traditional workforce/labour decline and population growth are straining global food security. The need for high-speed and reliable wireless communication in agriculture is becoming more of a necessity rather than a technological demonstration or showing superiority in the field. Governments and industries around the world are seeing more urgency in establishing communication infrastructure to scale up agricultural activities and improve sustainability, by employing autonomous agri-robotics and agri-technologies. The work presented here evaluates the physical performance of 5G in an agri-robotics application, and the results are compared against 4G and WiFi6 (a newly emerging wireless communication standard), which are typically used in agricultural environments. In addition, a series of simulation experiments were performed to assess the ``real-time'' operational delay in critical tasks that may require a human-in-the-loop to support decision making. The results lead to the conclusion that 4G cannot be used in the agricultural domain for applications that require high throughput and reliable communication between robot and user. Moreover, a single wireless solution does not exist for the agricultural domain, but instead multiple solutions can be combined to meet the necessary telecommunications requirements. Finally, the results show that 5G greatly outperforms 4G in all performance metrics, and on average only 18.2ms slower than WiFi6 making it very reliable.\nTime series numerical association rule mining variants in smart agriculture\t\"Iztok Fister Jr., \n      \n      Dušan Fister, \n      \n      Iztok Fister, \n      \n      Vili Podgorelec, \n      \n      Sancho Salcedo-Sanz\"\t2022/12/07\tNumerical association rule mining offers a very efficient way of mining association rules, where algorithms can operate directly with categorical and numerical attributes. These methods are suitable for mining different transaction databases, where data are entered sequentially. However, little attention has been paid to the time series numerical association rule mining, which offers a new technique for extracting association rules from time series data. This paper presents a new algorithmic method for time series numerical association rule mining and its application in smart agriculture. We offer a concept of a hardware environment for monitoring plant parameters and a novel data mining method with practical experiments. The practical experiments showed the method's potential and opened the door for further extension.\nBarriers to implementation of blockchain technology in agricultural supply chain\t\"David Cuellar, \n      \n      Zechariah Johnson\"\t2022/12/06\tEmerging technologies, such as Blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT), have had an immense role in propelling the agricultural industry towards the fourth agricultural revolution. Blockchain and IoT can greatly improve the traceability, efficiency, and safety of food along the supply chain. Given these contributions, there are many barriers to widespread adoption of this technology, including a deficit in many workers' ability to understand and effectively use this technology in addition to a lack of infrastructure to educate and support these workers. This paper discusses the barriers to adoption of blockchain and IoT technology in the agricultural supply chain. The authors analyse the impact of Blockchain and IoT in the food supply chain and methods in which governments and corporations can become more adaptable. Through the reduction in imports and protection of demand for local farmers, developing economies can create local sustainable agricultural ecosystems. Furthermore, the use of both public and private Research and Development can greatly contribute to the global knowledge on new technologies and improve many aspects of the food supply chain. In conclusion, both governments and corporations have a big role to play in the increased implementation of progressive technologies and the overall improvement of the food supply chain along with it.\nApplications of Machine Learning for the Ratemaking in Agricultural Insurances\tLuigi Biagini\t2022/12/19\tThis paper evaluates Machine Learning (ML) in establishing ratemaking for new insurance schemes. To make the evaluation feasible, we established expected indemnities as premiums. Then, we use ML to forecast indemnities using a minimum set of variables. The analysis simulates the introduction of an income insurance scheme, the so-called Income Stabilization Tool (IST), in Italy as a case study using farm-level data from the FADN from 2008-2018. We predicted the expected IST indemnities using three ML tools, LASSO, Elastic Net, and Boosting, that perform variable selection, comparing with the Generalized Linear Model (baseline) usually adopted in insurance investigations. Furthermore, Tweedie distribution is implemented to consider the peculiarity shape of the indemnities function, characterized by zero-inflated, no-negative value, and asymmetric fat-tail. The robustness of the results was evaluated by comparing the econometric and economic performance of the models. Specifically, ML has obtained the best goodness-of-fit than baseline, using a small and stable selection of regressors and significantly reducing the gathering cost of information. However, Boosting enabled it to obtain the best economic performance, balancing the most and most minor risky subjects optimally and achieving good economic sustainability. These findings suggest how machine learning can be successfully applied in agricultural insurance.This study represents one of the first to use ML and Tweedie distribution in agricultural insurance, demonstrating its potential to overcome multiple issues.\nEvaluating Digital Agriculture Recommendations with Causal Inference\t\"Ilias Tsoumas, \n      \n      Georgios Giannarakis, \n      \n      Vasileios Sitokonstantinou, \n      \n      Alkiviadis Koukos, \n      \n      Dimitra Loka, \n      \n      Nikola",

While AI-driven digital agriculture tools can offer high-performing predictive functionalities, they lack tangible quantitative evidence on their benefits to the farmers. Field experiments can derive such evidence, but are often costly, time consuming and hence limited in scope and scale of application. To this end, we propose an observational causal inference framework for the empirical evaluation of the impact of digital tools on target farm performance indicators (e.g., yield in this case). This way, we can increase farmers' trust via enhancing the transparency of the digital agriculture market and accelerate the adoption of technologies that aim to secure farmer income resilience and global agricultural sustainability. As a case study, we designed and implemented a recommendation system for the optimal sowing time of cotton based on numerical weather predictions, which was used by a farmers' cooperative during the growing season of 2021. We then leverage agricultural knowledge, collected yield data, and environmental information to develop a causal graph of the farm system. Using the back-door criterion, we identify the impact of sowing recommendations on the yield and subsequently estimate it using linear regression, matching, inverse propensity score weighting and meta-learners. The results reveal that a field sown according to our recommendations exhibited a statistically significant yield increase that ranged from 12% to 17%, depending on the method. The effect estimates were robust, as indicated by the agreement among the estimation methods and four successful refutation tests. We argue that this approach can be implemented for decision support systems of other fields, extending their evaluation beyond a performance assessment of internal functionalities.\nInterpretability and accessibility of machine learning in selected food processing, agriculture and health applications\t\"N.

Halgamuge\"\t2022/11/29\tArtificial Intelligence (AI) and its data-centric branch of machine learning (ML) have greatly evolved over the last few decades. However, as AI is used increasingly in real world use cases, the importance of the interpretability of and accessibility to AI systems have become major research areas. The lack of interpretability of ML based systems is a major hindrance to widespread adoption of these powerful algorithms. This is due to many reasons including ethical and regulatory concerns, which have resulted in poorer adoption of ML in some areas. The recent past has seen a surge in research on interpretable ML. Generally, designing a ML system requires good domain understanding combined with expert knowledge. New techniques are emerging to improve ML accessibility through automated model design. This paper provides a review of the work done to improve interpretability and accessibility of machine learning in the context of global problems while also being relevant to developing countries. We review work under multiple levels of interpretability including scientific and mathematical interpretation, statistical interpretation and partial semantic interpretation. This review includes applications in three areas, namely food processing, agriculture and health.\nLettuce modelling for growth control in precision agriculture\t\"William Rohde, \n      \n      Fulvio Forni\"\t2023/06/01\tImproving the efficiency of agriculture is a growing priority due to food security issues, environmental concerns, and economics. Precision agriculture and variable rate application technology could enable increases in yield while maintaining or reducing fertiliser use. However, this requires the development of control algorithms which are suitable for the challenges of agriculture. In this paper, we propose a new mechanistic open model of lettuce growth for use in control of precision agriculture. We demonstrate that our model is cooperative and fits well to experimental data. We use the model to show, via simulations, that a simple proportional distributed control law increases crop uniformity and yield without increasing nitrogen use, even in the presence of sparse actuation and noisy observations.\nBig Earth Data and Machine Learning for Sustainable and Resilient Agriculture\tVasileios Sitokonstantinou\t2022/11/22\t\"Big streams of Earth images from satellites or other platforms (e.g., drones and mobile phones) are becoming increasingly available at low or no cost and with enhanced spatial and temporal resolution. This thesis recognizes the unprecedented opportunities offered by the high quality and open access Earth observation data of our times and introduces novel machine learning and big data methods to properly exploit them towards developing applications for sustainable and resilient agriculture. The thesis addresses three distinct thematic areas, i.e., the monitoring of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the monitoring of food security and applications for smart and resilient agriculture. The methodological innovations of the developments related to the three thematic areas address the following issues: i) the processing of big Earth Observation (EO) data, ii) the scarcity of annotated data for machine learning model training and iii) the gap between machine learning outputs and actionable advice.\n  This thesis demonstrated how big data technologies such as data cubes, distributed learning, linked open data and semantic enrichment can be used to exploit the data deluge and extract knowledge to address real user needs.

Specifically, it is shown how merely few ground truth data are needed to generate high quality crop type maps and crop phenology estimations. Finally, this thesis argues there is considerable distance in value between model inferences and decision making in real-world scenarios and thereby showcases the power of causal and interpretable machine learning in bridging this gap.\"\nSmart Agriculture : A Novel Multilevel Approach for Agricultural Risk Assessment over Unstructured Data\t\"Hasna Najmi, \n      \n      Mounia Mikram, \n      \n      Maryem Rhanoui, \n      \n      Siham Yousfi\"\t2022/11/22\tDetecting opportunities and threats from massive text data is a challenging task for most. Traditionally, companies would rely mainly on structured data to detect and predict risks, losing a huge amount of information that could be extracted from unstructured text data. Fortunately, artificial intelligence came to remedy this issue by innovating in data extraction and processing techniques, allowing us to understand and make use of Natural Language data and turning it into structures that a machine can process and extract insight from. Uncertainty refers to a state of not knowing what will happen in the future. This paper aims to leverage natural language processing and machine learning techniques to model uncertainties and evaluate the risk level in each uncertainty cluster using massive text data.\nDesign of an Autonomous Agriculture Robot for Real Time Weed Detection using CNN\t\"Dhruv Patel, \n      \n      Meet Gandhi, \n      \n      Shankaranarayanan H., \n      \n      Anand D. Darji\"\t2022/11/22\tAgriculture has always remained an integral part of the world. As the human population keeps on rising, the demand for food also increases, and so is the dependency on the agriculture industry. But in today's scenario, because of low yield, less rainfall, etc., a dearth of manpower is created in this agricultural sector, and people are moving to live in the cities, and villages are becoming more and more urbanized. On the other hand, the field of robotics has seen tremendous development in the past few years. The concepts like Deep Learning (DL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) are being incorporated with robotics to create autonomous systems for various sectors like automotive, agriculture, assembly line management, etc. Deploying such autonomous systems in the agricultural sector help in many aspects like reducing manpower, better yield, and nutritional quality of crops. So, in this paper, the system design of an autonomous agricultural robot which primarily focuses on weed detection is described. A modified deep-learning model for the purpose of weed detection is also proposed. The primary objective of this robot is the detection of weed on a real-time basis without any human involvement, but it can also be extended to design robots in various other applications involved in farming like weed removal, plowing, harvesting, etc., in turn making the farming industry more efficient.

We assess the role of sanctions on the Russian international trade flow of agricultural products after 2014. We use a differences-in-differences model of trade flows data for imported and exported agricultural products from 2010 to 2020 in Russia. The main expectation was that the Russian economy would take a hit since it had lost its importers. We assess the economic impact of the Russian food embargo on agricultural commodities, questioning whether it has achieved its objective and resulted in a window of opportunity for the development of the domestic agricultural sector. Our results confirm that the sanctions have significantly impacted foodstuff imports; they have almost halved in the first two years since the sanctions were imposed. However, Russia has embarked on a path to reduce dependence on food imports and managed self-sufficient agricultural production.\n3D Reconstruction-Based Seed Counting of Sorghum Panicles for Agricultural Inspection\t\"Harry Freeman, \n      \n      Eric Schneider, \n      \n      Chung Hee Kim, \n      \n      Moonyoung Lee, \n      \n      George Kantor\"\t2022/11/14\tIn this paper, we present a method for creating high-quality 3D models of sorghum panicles for phenotyping in breeding experiments.

To evaluate the performance, we develop a new metric for assessing the quality of reconstructed point clouds without having a ground-truth point cloud. Finally, a counting method is presented where the density of seed centers in the 3D model allows 2D counts from multiple views to be effectively combined into a whole-panicle count. We demonstrate that using this method to estimate seed count and weight for sorghum outperforms count extrapolation from 2D images, an approach used in most state of the art methods for seeds and grains of comparable size.\nEvaluating Digital Tools for Sustainable Agriculture using Causal Inference\t\"Ilias Tsoumas, \n      \n      Georgios Giannarakis, \n      \n      Vasileios Sitokonstantinou, \n      \n      Alkiviadis",

Even though AI-driven digital agriculture can offer high-performing predictive functionalities, it lacks tangible quantitative evidence on its benefits to the farmers. Field experiments can derive such evidence, but are often costly and time consuming. To this end, we propose an observational causal inference framework for the empirical evaluation of the impact of digital tools on target farm performance indicators. This way, we can increase farmers' trust by enhancing the transparency of the digital agriculture market, and in turn accelerate the adoption of technologies that aim to increase productivity and secure a sustainable and resilient agriculture against a changing climate. As a case study, we perform an empirical evaluation of a recommendation system for optimal cotton sowing, which was used by a farmers' cooperative during the growing season of 2021. We leverage agricultural knowledge to develop a causal graph of the farm system, we use the back-door criterion to identify the impact of recommendations on the yield and subsequently estimate it using several methods on observational data. The results show that a field sown according to our recommendations enjoyed a significant increase in yield (12% to 17%).\nPersonalizing Sustainable Agriculture with Causal Machine Learning\t\"Georgios Giannarakis, \n      \n      Vasileios Sitokonstantinou, \n      \n      Roxanne Suzette Lorilla, \n      \n      Charalampos Kontoes\"\t2022/11/06\tTo fight climate change and accommodate the increasing population, global crop production has to be strengthened. To achieve the \"sustainable intensification\" of agriculture, transforming it from carbon emitter to carbon sink is a priority, and understanding the environmental impact of agricultural management practices is a fundamental prerequisite to that. At the same time, the global agricultural landscape is deeply heterogeneous, with differences in climate, soil, and land use inducing variations in how agricultural systems respond to farmer actions. The \"personalization\" of sustainable agriculture with the provision of locally adapted management advice is thus a necessary condition for the efficient uplift of green metrics, and an integral development in imminent policies. Here, we formulate personalized sustainable agriculture as a Conditional Average Treatment Effect estimation task and use Causal Machine Learning for tackling it. Leveraging climate data, land use information and employing Double Machine Learning, we estimate the heterogeneous effect of sustainable practices on the field-level Soil Organic Carbon content in Lithuania. We thus provide a data-driven perspective for targeting sustainable practices and effectively expanding the global carbon sink.\nInside Out: Transforming Images of Lab-Grown Plants for Machine Learning Applications in Agriculture\t\"A.

Bidinosti\"\t2022/11/05\tMachine learning tasks often require a significant amount of training data for the resultant network to perform suitably for a given problem in any domain. In agriculture, dataset sizes are further limited by phenotypical differences between two plants of the same genotype, often as a result of differing growing conditions. Synthetically-augmented datasets have shown promise in improving existing models when real data is not available. In this paper, we employ a contrastive unpaired translation (CUT) generative adversarial network (GAN) and simple image processing techniques to translate indoor plant images to appear as field images. While we train our network to translate an image containing only a single plant, we show that our method is easily extendable to produce multiple-plant field images. Furthermore, we use our synthetic multi-plant images to train several YoloV5 nano object detection models to perform the task of plant detection and measure the accuracy of the model on real field data images. Including training data generated by the CUT-GAN leads to better plant detection performance compared to a network trained solely on real data.\nA Survey of Computer Vision Technologies In Urban and Controlled-environment Agriculture\t\"Jiayun Luo, \n      \n      Boyang Li, \n      \n      Cyril Leung\"\t2023/10/12\tIn the evolution of agriculture to its next stage, Agriculture 5.0, artificial intelligence will play a central role. Controlled-environment agriculture, or CEA, is a special form of urban and suburban agricultural practice that offers numerous economic, environmental, and social benefits, including shorter transportation routes to population centers, reduced environmental impact, and increased productivity. Due to its ability to control environmental factors, CEA couples well with computer vision (CV) in the adoption of real-time monitoring of the plant conditions and autonomous cultivation and harvesting. The objective of this paper is to familiarize CV researchers with agricultural applications and agricultural practitioners with the solutions offered by CV. We identify five major CV applications in CEA, analyze their requirements and motivation, and survey the state of the art as reflected in 68 technical papers using deep learning methods. In addition, we discuss five key subareas of computer vision and how they related to these CEA problems, as well as eleven vision-based CEA datasets. We hope the survey will help researchers quickly gain a bird-eye view of the striving research area and will spark inspiration for new research and development.\nCryptocurrency,",

The paper will discuss the impact the 2022 Russian Sanctions have on agricultural food prices and hunger. The paper also uses Instrumental Variable Analysis to find how Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin can be used to hedge against the impact of sanctions. The 6 different countries analyzed in this study including Bangladesh, El Salvador, Iran, Nigeria, Philippines, and South Africa, all of which are heavy importers of wheat and corn. The paper shows that although Bitcoin may be volatile compared to other local currencies, it might be a good investment to safeguard assets since it is not correlated with commodity prices.Furthermore, the study demonstrates that transaction volume has a strong relationship with prices.\nHierarchical Approach for Joint Semantic, Plant Instance, and Leaf Instance Segmentation in the Agricultural Domain\t\"Gianmarco Roggiolani, \n      \n      Matteo Sodano, \n      \n      Tiziano Guadagnino, \n      \n      Federico Magistri, \n      \n      Jens Behley, \n      \n      Cyrill Stachniss\"\t2023/06/14\tPlant phenotyping is a central task in agriculture, as it describes plants' growth stage, development, and other relevant quantities. Robots can help automate this process by accurately estimating plant traits such as the number of leaves, leaf area, and the plant size. In this paper, we address the problem of joint semantic, plant instance, and leaf instance segmentation of crop fields from RGB data. We propose a single convolutional neural network that addresses the three tasks simultaneously, exploiting their underlying hierarchical structure. We introduce task-specific skip connections, which our experimental evaluation proves to be more beneficial than the usual schemes. We also propose a novel automatic post-processing, which explicitly addresses the problem of spatially close instances, common in the agricultural domain because of overlapping leaves. Our architecture simultaneously tackles these problems jointly in the agricultural context. Previous works either focus on plant or leaf segmentation, or do not optimise for semantic segmentation. Results show that our system has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while having a reduced number of parameters and is operating at camera frame rate.\nFields2Cover: An open-source coverage path planning library for unmanned agricultural vehicles\t\"Gonzalo Mier, \n      \n      João Valente, \n      \n      Sytze de Bruin\"\t2023/02/17\tThis paper describes Fields2Cover, a novel open source library for coverage path planning (CPP) for agricultural vehicles. While there are several CPP solutions nowadays, there have been limited efforts to unify them into an open source library and provide benchmarking tools to compare their performance. Fields2Cover provides a framework for planning coverage paths, developing novel techniques, and benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms. The library features a modular and extensible architecture that supports various vehicles and can be used for a variety of applications, including farms. Its core modules are: a headland generator, a swath generator, a route planner and a path planner. An interface to the Robot Operating System (ROS) is also supplied as an add-on. In this paper, the functionalities of the library for planning a coverage path in agriculture are demonstrated using 8 state-of-the-art methods and 7 objective functions in simulation and field experiments.\nA systematic review of the use of Deep Learning in Satellite Imagery for Agriculture\t\"Brandon Victor, \n      \n      Zhen He, \n      \n      Aiden Nibali\"\t2025/01/13\tAgricultural research is essential for increasing food production to meet the requirements of an increasing population in the coming decades. Recently, satellite technology has been improving rapidly and deep learning has seen much success in generic computer vision tasks and many application areas which presents an important opportunity to improve analysis of agricultural land. Here we present a systematic review of 150 studies to find the current uses of deep learning on satellite imagery for agricultural research. Although we identify 5 categories of agricultural monitoring tasks, the majority of the research interest is in crop segmentation and yield prediction. We found that, when used, modern deep learning methods consistently outperformed traditional machine learning across most tasks; the only exception was that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks did not consistently outperform Random Forests (RF) for yield prediction. The reviewed studies have largely adopted methodologies from generic computer vision, except for one major omission: benchmark datasets are not utilised to evaluate models across studies, making it difficult to compare results. Additionally, some studies have specifically utilised the extra spectral resolution available in satellite imagery, but other divergent properties of satellite images - such as the hugely different scales of spatial patterns - are not being taken advantage of in the reviewed studies.\nOAK4XAI: Model towards Out-Of-Box eXplainable Artificial Intelligence for Digital Agriculture\t\"Quoc Hung Ngo, \n      \n      Tahar Kechadi, \n      \n      Nhien-An Le-Khac\"\t2022/09/29\tRecent machine learning approaches have been effective in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications.

They produce robust results with a high level of accuracy. However, most of these techniques do not provide human-understandable explanations for supporting their results and decisions. They usually act as black boxes, and it is not easy to understand how decisions have been made. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which has received much interest recently, tries to provide human-understandable explanations for decision-making and trained AI models. For instance, in digital agriculture, related domains often present peculiar or input features with no link to background knowledge. The application of the data mining process on agricultural data leads to results (knowledge), which are difficult to explain. In this paper, we propose a knowledge map model and an ontology design as an XAI framework (OAK4XAI) to deal with this issue. The framework does not only consider the data analysis part of the process, but it takes into account the semantics aspect of the domain knowledge via an ontology and a knowledge map model, provided as modules of the framework. Many ongoing XAI studies aim to provide accurate and verbalizable accounts for how given feature values contribute to model decisions. The proposed approach, however, focuses on providing consistent information and definitions of concepts, algorithms, and values involved in the data mining models. We built an Agriculture Computing Ontology (AgriComO) to explain the knowledge mined in agriculture. AgriComO has a well-designed structure and includes a wide range of concepts and transformations suitable for agriculture and computing domains.\nA Novel Dataset for Evaluating and Alleviating Domain Shift for Human Detection in Agricultural Fields\t\"Paraskevi Nousi, \n      \n      Emmanouil Mpampis, \n      \n      Nikolaos Passalis, \n      \n      Ole Green, \n      \n      Anastasios Tefas\"\t2022/09/27\tIn this paper we evaluate the impact of domain shift on human detection models trained on well known object detection datasets when deployed on data outside the distribution of the training set, as well as propose methods to alleviate such phenomena based on the available annotations from the target domain. Specifically, we introduce the OpenDR Humans in Field dataset, collected in the context of agricultural robotics applications, using the Robotti platform, allowing for quantitatively measuring the impact of domain shift in such applications. Furthermore, we examine the importance of manual annotation by evaluating three distinct scenarios concerning the training data: a) only negative samples, i.e., no depicted humans, b) only positive samples, i.e., only images which contain humans, and c) both negative and positive samples. Our results indicate that good performance can be achieved even when using only negative samples, if additional consideration is given to the training process. We also find that positive samples increase performance especially in terms of better localization. The dataset is publicly available for download at https://github.com/opendr-eu/datasets.\nIoT-Aerial Base Station Task Offloading with Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning for Smart Agriculture\t\"Turgay Pamuklu, \n      \n      Anne Catherine Nguyen, \n      \n      Aisha Syed, \n      \n      W. Sean Kennedy, \n      \n      Melike Erol-Kantarci\"\t2022/09/15\tAerial base stations (ABSs) allow smart farms to offload processing responsibility of complex tasks from internet of things (IoT) devices to ABSs. IoT devices have limited energy and computing resources, thus it is required to provide an advanced solution for a system that requires the support of ABSs. This paper introduces a novel multi-actor-based risk-sensitive reinforcement learning approach for ABS task scheduling for smart agriculture. The problem is defined as task offloading with a strict condition on completing the IoT tasks before their deadlines. Moreover, the algorithm must also consider the limited energy capacity of the ABSs. The results show that our proposed approach outperforms several heuristics and the classic Q-Learning approach. Furthermore, we provide a mixed integer linear programming solution to determine a lower bound on the performance, and clarify the gap between our risk-sensitive solution and the optimal solution, as well. The comparison proves our extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method is a promising approach for providing a guaranteed task processing services for the IoT tasks in a smart farm, while increasing the hovering time of the ABSs in this farm.\nShape optimization of flywheel used in agricultural thresher\t\"Prafull Bhosale, \n      \n      Umesh Zawar\"\t2022/08/13\tThis research paper presents the procedure for shape optimization of flywheel used in an agricultural thresher machine using a cubic B-spline curve and the Jaya algorithm. The flywheel is an essential element for storing kinetic energy in modern machines. Shape optimization of the flywheel was carried out using a cubic B-spline curve to maximize the kinetic energy of the flywheel subjected to constraints of mass of flywheel and permissible value of Von-Mises stress in a flywheel. The B-spline curve was used as it gives local control and is not restricted by control points. The control points of the B-spline are considered design variables. The Von-Mises stresses at all points in the flywheel are determined by solving two-point boundary value differential equations using the finite difference method. Finally, the optimization problem was solved using the Jaya algorithm. These results are then compared with results obtained using other nature-inspired algorithms like a genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), and it is found that the Jaya algorithm gives better results.

However, farmers are not necessarily experts in robotics technology and will not adopt technologies that add to their workload or do not provide an immediate payoff. In this work, we explore methods for communication between a remote human operator and multiple agbots and examine the impact of audio communication on the operator's preferences and productivity. We develop a simulation platform where agbots are deployed across a field, randomly encounter failures, and call for help from the operator. As the agbots report errors, various audio communication mechanisms are tested to convey which robot failed and what type of failure occurs. The human is tasked with verbally diagnosing the failure while completing a secondary task. A user study was conducted to test three audio communication methods: earcons, single-phrase commands, and full sentence communication. Each participant completed a survey to determine their preferences and each method's overall effectiveness. Our results suggest that the system using single phrases is the most positively perceived by participants and may allow for the human to complete the secondary task more efficiently. The code is available at: https://github.com/akamboj2/Agbot-Sim.\nLinking Common Multispectral Vegetation Indices to Hyperspectral Mixture Models: Results from 5 nm, 3 m Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy in a Diverse Agricultural Landscape\t\"Daniel Sousa, \n      \n      Christopher Small\"\t2022/08/12\tFor decades, agronomists have used remote sensing to monitor key crop parameters like biomass, fractional cover, and plant health. Vegetation indices (VIs) are popular for this purpose, primarily leveraging the spectral red edge in multispectral imagery. In contrast, spectral mixture models use the full reflectance spectrum to simultaneously estimate area fractions of multiple endmember materials present within a mixed pixel. Here, we characterize the relationships between hyperspectral endmember fractions and 6 common multispectral VIs in crops & soils of California agriculture. Fractional area of green vegetation (Fv) was estimated directly from 64,000,000 5 nm, 3 to 5 m reflectance spectra compiled from a mosaic of 15 AVIRIS-ng flightlines. Simulated Planet SuperDove reflectance spectra were then derived from the AVIRIS-ng, and used to compute 6 popular VIs (NDVI, NIRv, EVI, EVI2, SR, DVI). Multispectral VIs were compared to hyperspectral Fv using parametric (Pearson correlation, r) and nonparametric (Mutual Information, MI) similarity metrics. 4 VIs (NIRv, DVI, EVI, EVI2) showed strong linear relationships to Fv (r > 0.94; MI > 1.2). NIRv & DVI showed strong interrelation (r > 0.99, MI > 2.4), but deviated significantly from 1:1 relative to Fv. EVI & EVI2 were also strongly interrelated (r > 0.99, MI > 2.3) and more closely followed a 1:1 relation with Fv. In contrast, NDVI & SR showed weaker, nonlinear, heteroskedastic relation to Fv (r < 0.84, MI = 0.69). NDVI showed especially severe sensitivity to substrate background reflectance (-0.05 < NDVI < +0.6 for unvegetated spectra) and saturation (0.2 < Fv < 0.8 for NDVI = 0.7). These direct observational constraints on multispectral VI and hyperspectral mixture model comparability can serve as a quantitative benchmark for agronomic applications in the coming era of increasing spatial & spectral resolution Earth observation.\nStandardizing and Centralizing Datasets to Enable Efficient Training of Agricultural Deep Learning Models\t\"Amogh Joshi, \n      \n      Dario Guevara, \n      \n      Mason Earles\"\t2022/08/04\tIn recent years, deep learning models have become the standard for agricultural computer vision. Such models are typically fine-tuned to agricultural tasks using model weights that were originally fit to more general, non-agricultural datasets. This lack of agriculture-specific fine-tuning potentially increases training time and resource use, and decreases model performance, leading an overall decrease in data efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we collect a wide range of existing public datasets for three distinct tasks, standardize them, and construct standard training and evaluation pipelines, providing us with a set of benchmarks and pretrained models. We then conduct a number of experiments using methods which are commonly used in deep learning tasks, but unexplored in their domain-specific applications for agriculture.

Our methods are broadly applicable throughout agricultural deep learning, and present high potential for significant data efficiency improvements.\nAutonomous Agriculture Robot for Smart Farming\t\"Vinay Ummadi, \n      \n      Aravind Gundlapalle, \n      \n      Althaf Shaik, \n      \n      Shaik Mohammad Rafi B\"\t2023/09/07\tThis project aims to develop and demonstrate a ground robot with intelligence capable of conducting semi-autonomous farm operations for different low-heights vegetable crops referred as Agriculture Application Robot(AAR).

Despite its importance in securing India's food security, the potential advantages of inland trade remain unexplored. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of agricultural flows and contrast it with non-agricultural commodities flow across Indian states. The spatiotemporal evolution of both the networks for the period 2010 to 2018 was studied and compared using network properties along with the total traded value. Our results show an increase in annual traded volume by nearly 37 % and 87 %, respectively, for agriculture and non-agriculture trade. An increase in total trade volume without a significant increase in connectivity over the analyzed time-period is observed in both networks, reveals the over-reliance and increased dependency on particular export hubs. Our analysis further revealed a more homogeneous distribution between import and export connection nodes for agriculture trade compared to non-agriculture trade, where Indian states with high exports also have high imports. Overall our analysis provide a quantitative description of Indian inland trade as a complex network that could further us design resilient trade networks within the nation.\nImproved lightweight identification of agricultural diseases based on MobileNetV3\t\"Yuhang Jiang, \n      \n      Wenping Tong\"\t2022/07/19\tAt present, the identification of agricultural pests and diseases has the problem that the model is not lightweight enough and difficult to apply.

As compared with routine lab analysis, our mobile soil analysis system has correctly classified soil pH in 97% of cases while reducing the analysis turnaround time from days to minutes. Moreover, by performing on-the-spot analyses of individual compound sub-samples in the field, we have achieved a 9-fold increase of spatial resolution that reveals pH-variations not detectable in compound mapping mode. Our mobile system can be extended to perform multi-parameter chemical tests of soil nutrients for applications in environmental monitoring at marginal manufacturing cost.\nAdoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices among Kentucky Farmers and Their Perception about Farm Sustainability\tBijesh Mishra\t2022/07/16\tThe purpose of this research was to identify commonly adopted SAPs and their adoption among Kentucky farmers. The specific objectives were to explore farmers' Perceptions about farm and farming practice sustainability, to identify predictors of SAPs adoption using farm attributes, farmers' attitudes and behaviors, socioeconomic and demographic factors, and knowledge, and to evaluate adoption barriers of SAPs among Kentucky Farmers. Farmers generally perceive that their farm and farming activities attain the objectives of sustainable agriculture. Inadequate knowledge, perceived difficulty of implementation, lack of market, negative attitude about technologies, and lack of technologies were major adoption barriers of SAPs in Kentucky.\nKnowledge Representation in Digital Agriculture: A Step Towards Standardised Model\t\"Quoc Hung Ngo, \n      \n      Tahar Kechadi, \n      \n      Nhien-An Le-Khac\"\t2022/07/15\tIn recent years, data science has evolved significantly. Data analysis and mining processes become routines in all sectors of the economy where datasets are available. Vast data repositories have been collected, curated, stored, and used for extracting knowledge. And this is becoming commonplace. Subsequently, we extract a large amount of knowledge, either directly from the data or through experts in the given domain. The challenge now is how to exploit all this large amount of knowledge that is previously known for efficient decision-making processes. Until recently, much of the knowledge gained through a number of years of research is stored in static knowledge bases or ontologies, while more diverse and dynamic knowledge acquired from data mining studies is not centrally and consistently managed. In this research, we propose a novel model called ontology-based knowledge map to represent and store the results (knowledge) of data mining in crop farming to build, maintain, and enrich the process of knowledge discovery. The proposed model consists of six main sets: concepts, attributes, relations, transformations, instances, and states. This model is dynamic and facilitates the access, updates, and exploitation of the knowledge at any time. This paper also proposes an architecture for handling this knowledge-based model. The system architecture includes knowledge modelling, extraction, assessment, publishing, and exploitation. This system has been implemented and used in agriculture for crop management and monitoring. It is proven to be very effective and promising for its extension to other domains.\nThe Power of Transfer Learning in Agricultural Applications: AgriNet\t\"Zahraa Al Sahili, \n      \n      Mariette Awad\"\t2022/10/06\tAdvances in deep learning and transfer learning have paved the way for various automation classification tasks in agriculture, including plant diseases, pests, weeds, and plant species detection. However, agriculture automation still faces various challenges, such as the limited size of datasets and the absence of plant-domain-specific pretrained models. Domain specific pretrained models have shown state of art performance in various computer vision tasks including face recognition and medical imaging diagnosis. In this paper, we propose AgriNet dataset, a collection of 160k agricultural images from more than 19 geographical locations, several images captioning devices, and more than 423 classes of plant species and diseases. We also introduce AgriNet models, a set of pretrained models on five ImageNet architectures: VGG16, VGG19, Inception-v3, InceptionResNet-v2, and Xception. AgriNet-VGG19 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 94 % and the highest F1-score of 92%. Additionally, all proposed models were found to accurately classify the 423 classes of plant species, diseases, pests, and weeds with a minimum accuracy of 87% for the Inception-v3 model.Finally, experiments to evaluate of superiority of AgriNet models compared to ImageNet models were conducted on two external datasets: pest and plant diseases dataset from Bangladesh and a plant diseases dataset from Kashmir.\nHabitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes improving multi-functionality of constructed wetlands as nature-based solutions\t\"Clémentine Préau, \n      \n      Julien Tournebize, \n      \n      Maxime Lenormand, \n      \n      Samuel Alleaume, \n      \n      Véronique Gouy Boussada, \n      \n      Sandra Luque\"\t2022/07/08\tThe prevention of biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes to protect ecosystem stability and functions is of major importance in itself and for the maintenance of associated ecosystem services.

In karstic watersheds where sinkholes short-cut surface water directly to groundwater increasing water resource vulnerability, constructed wetlands are recommended to mitigate agricultural pollutants. Constructed wetlands also have the potential to improve landscape connectivity by providing refuge and breeding sites for wildlife, especially for amphibians. We propose here a methodology to identify optimal locations for water pollution mitigation using constructed wetlands from the perspective of habitat connectivity. We use ecological niche modelling at the regional scale to model the potential of habitat suitability for nine amphibian species, and to infer how the landscape impedes species movements. We combine those results to graph theory to identify connectivity priorities at the operational scale of an agricultural catchment area. Our framework allowed us to identify optimal areas from the point of view of the species, to analyze the effect of multifunctional constructed wetlands aiming to both reduce water pollution and to improve amphibian species habitat overall connectivity. More generally, we show the potential of habitat connectivity assessment to improve multifunctionality of NBS for pollution mitigation.\nReducing US Biofuels Requirements Mitigates Short-term Impacts of Global Population and Income Growth on Agricultural Environmental Outcomes\t\"David R.

These policies are motivated by energy security and climate change mitigation objectives, but corn ethanol does not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to petroleum-based fuels. Corn production also imposes substantial negative externalities (e.g., nitrogen leaching, higher food prices, water scarcity, and indirect land use change). In this paper, we utilize a partial equilibrium model of corn-soy production and trade to analyze the potential of reduced US demand for corn as a biobased energy feedstock to mitigate increases in nitrogen leaching, crop production and land use associated with growing global populations and income from 2020 to 2050. We estimate that a 23% demand reduction would sustain land use and nitrogen leaching below 2020 levels through the year 2025, and a 41% reduction would do so through 2030. Outcomes are similar across major watersheds where corn and soy are intensively farmed.\nExplicitly incorporating spatial information to recurrent networks for agriculture\t\"Claus Smitt, \n      \n      Michael Halstead, \n      \n      Alireza Ahmadi, \n      \n      Chris McCool\"\t2022/06/27\tIn agriculture, the majority of vision systems perform still image classification. Yet, recent work has highlighted the potential of spatial and temporal cues as a rich source of information to improve the classification performance. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to explicitly capture both spatial and temporal information to improve the classification of deep convolutional neural networks. We leverage available RGB-D images and robot odometry to perform inter-frame feature map spatial registration. This information is then fused within recurrent deep learnt models, to improve their accuracy and robustness. We demonstrate that this can considerably improve the classification performance with our best performing spatial-temporal model (ST-Atte) achieving absolute performance improvements for intersection-over-union (IoU[%]) of 4.7 for crop-weed segmentation and 2.6 for fruit (sweet pepper) segmentation. Furthermore, we show that these approaches are robust to variable framerates and odometry errors, which are frequently observed in real-world applications.\nAgriculture-Vision Challenge 2022 -- The Runner-Up Solution for Agricultural Pattern Recognition via Transformer-based Models\t\"Zhicheng Yang, \n      \n      Jui-Hsin Lai, \n      \n      Jun Zhou, \n      \n      Hang Zhou, \n      \n      Chen Du, \n      \n      Zhongcheng Lai\"\t2022/06/23\tThe Agriculture-Vision Challenge in CVPR is one of the most famous and competitive challenges for global researchers to break the boundary between computer vision and agriculture sectors, aiming at agricultural pattern recognition from aerial images.

We leverage a data pre-processing scheme and several Transformer-based models as well as data augmentation techniques to achieve a mIoU of 0.582, accomplishing the 2nd place in this challenge.\nAgricultural Plantation Classification using Transfer Learning Approach based on CNN\t\"Uphar Singh, \n      \n      Tushar Musale, \n      \n      Ranjana Vyas, \n      \n      O.

It makes them well suited for the classification of objects in a snap. In the past years, the efficiency of hyper-spectral image recognition has increased significantly with deep learning. The Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP) has demonstrated to be an excellent process of classifying images. However, they suffer from the issues of long training time and requirement of large amounts of the labeled data, to achieve the expected outcome.

This work addresses this issue by using business process management (BPM) to demonstrate that the use of digital twins (DTs) can improve interoperability between services in the agriculture domain. Steps from the BPM lifecycle were applied to a farming use case in Germany. First, the as-is business process model was discovered and modeled without DTs, analyzed and then redesigned into the to-be model according to the DT integration. The to-be model showed a reduction in the number of tasks needed to be performed by the farmer as well as an improvement of process data quality, interoperability, and efficiency. Finally, a comparison of the' average processing times of both models with the help of process simulation revealed improvements in the to-be process.\nInternet of Things (IoT) based Smart Agriculture Aiming to Achieve Sustainable Goals\t\"Dewan Md Nur Anjum Ashir, \n      \n      Md.

Researchers are more focused on technological invention and model introduction rather than discussing societal or global development goals. Sustainable development goals (SDGs) designed by United Nations (UN), therefore demand discussions as SDGs targets have a closer implication of technology. To fill this gap, in this study a model of smart agriculture is developed and centring the model we investigated how the model addresses SDGs targets. The investigation suggests that smart agriculture supports targets mentioned in Goal 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of SDG. This research is very important, both for developing and developed nations since most of the nations are moving more towards industrialization and aiming to achieve the SDG goals This research is expected to provide a path to the IT practitioners, governments and developing agencies on how technological intervention can provide a more sustainable agricultural world.\nContinuous space core-periphery model with transport costs in differentiated agriculture\tKensuke Ohtake\t2025/03/10\tThe core-periphery model with transport costs in differentiated agriculture is extended to continuous space. A homogeneous stationary solution is unstable but exhibits redispersion that it is stabilized by sufficiently low manufacturing transport costs or sufficiently strong preference for manufacturing variety. It is numerically observed that a solution starting from around the unstable homogeneous solution eventually forms a spike-like agglomeration. Furthermore, the redispersion also appears in the sense that the number of the spikes goes from decreasing to increasing as the manufacturing transport costs decrease. It is also observed that lower agricultural transport costs and stronger preference for agricultural variety promote agglomeration.\nDesign of an embedded system with on-demand image capturing and transmission for remote agricultural monitoring\t\"Ivan Hu, \n      \n      Zihuai Lin\"\t2022/05/24\tThe ability to visually verify some element of a remotely controlled agricultural automation system through a photograph is valuable in many cases, not only in the operational phase of the system, but especially in the design and implementation phases. Owing to the remote location of many of the application sites, cellular technology is one enabling medium through which wireless transmission of the photographs could be realized. As data usage is a concern for systems using cellular technology, MQTT chosen over other protocols due to its lower message-to-header overhead. This paper outlines the hardware and firmware design of the LTE Cat-M1 enabled embedded system and the backend web development of the cloud-based web application to facilitate the receiving of the photograph. A satisfactory degree of implementation success was achieved in this project, with deployment to a production environment possible after further refinements.\nRobotic agricultural instrument for automated extraction of nematode cysts and eggs from soil to improve integrated pest management\t\"Christopher M.

The only definitive way to assess SCN population densities is to directly extract the SCN cysts from soil and then extract the eggs from cysts and count them. Extraction is typically conducted in commercial soil analysis laboratories and university plant diagnostic clinics and involves repeated steps of sieving, washing, collecting, grinding, and cleaning. Here we present a robotic instrument to reproduce and automate the functions of the conventional methods to extract nematode cysts from soil and subsequently extract eggs from the recovered nematode cysts. We incorporated mechanisms to actuate the stage system, manipulate positions of individual sieves using the gripper, recover cysts and cyst-sized objects from soil suspended in water, and grind the cysts to release their eggs. All system functions are controlled and operated by a touchscreen interface software. The performance of the robotic instrument is evaluated using soil samples infested with SCN from two farms at different locations and results were comparable to the conventional technique. Our new technology brings the benefits of automation to SCN soil diagnostics, a step towards long-term integrated pest management of this serious soybean pest.\nA Data Cube of Big Satellite Image Time-Series for Agriculture Monitoring\t\"Thanassis Drivas, \n      \n      Vasileios Sitokonstantinou, \n      \n      Iason Tsardanidis, \n      \n      Alkiviadis Koukos, \n      \n      Charalampos Kontoes, \n      \n      Vassilia Karathanassi\"\t2022/05/16\tThe modernization of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) requires the large scale and frequent monitoring of agricultural land. Towards this direction, the free and open satellite data (i.e., Sentinel missions) have been extensively used as the sources for the required high spatial and temporal resolution Earth observations. Nevertheless, monitoring the CAP at large scales constitutes a big data problem and puts a strain on CAP paying agencies that need to adapt fast in terms of infrastructure and know-how. Hence, there is a need for efficient and easy-to-use tools for the acquisition, storage, processing and exploitation of big satellite data. In this work, we present the Agriculture monitoring Data Cube (ADC), which is an automated, modular, end-to-end framework for discovering, pre-processing and indexing optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images into a multidimensional cube. We also offer a set of powerful tools on top of the ADC, including i) the generation of analysis-ready feature spaces of big satellite data to feed downstream machine learning tasks and ii) the support of Satellite Image Time-Series (SITS) analysis via services pertinent to the monitoring of the CAP (e.g., detecting trends and events, monitoring the growth status etc.). The knowledge extracted from the SITS analyses and the machine learning tasks returns to the data cube, building scalable country-specific knowledge bases that can efficiently answer complex and multi-faceted geospatial queries.\nTowards Space-to-Ground Data Availability for Agriculture Monitoring\t\"George Choumos, \n      \n      Alkiviadis Koukos, \n      \n      Vasileios Sitokonstantinou, \n      \n      Charalampos Kontoes\"\t2022/05/16\tThe recent advances in machine learning and the availability of free and open big Earth data (e.g., Sentinel missions), which cover large areas with high spatial and temporal resolution, have enabled many agriculture monitoring applications. One example is the control of subsidy allocations of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Advanced remote sensing systems have been developed towards the large-scale evidence-based monitoring of the CAP. Nevertheless, the spatial resolution of satellite images is not always adequate to make accurate decisions for all fields. In this work, we introduce the notion of space-to-ground data availability, i.e., from the satellite to the field, in an attempt to make the best out of the complementary characteristics of the different sources. We present a space-to-ground dataset that contains Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical image time-series, as well as street-level images from the crowdsourcing platform Mapillary, for grassland fields in the area of Utrecht for 2017. The multifaceted utility of our dataset is showcased through the downstream task of grassland classification. We train machine and deep learning algorithms on these different data domains and highlight the potential of fusion techniques towards increasing the reliability of decisions.\nTowards a Cybersecurity Testbed for Agricultural Vehicles and Environments\t\"Mark Freyhof, \n      \n      George Grispos, \n      \n      Santosh Pitla, \n      \n      Cody Stolle\"\t2022/05/11\tIn today's modern farm, an increasing number of agricultural systems and vehicles are connected to the Internet. While the benefits of networked agricultural machinery are attractive, this technological shift is also creating an environment that is conducive to cyberattacks. While previous research has focused on general cybersecurity concerns in the farming and agricultural industries, minimal research has focused on techniques for identifying security vulnerabilities within actual agricultural systems that could be exploited by cybercriminals. Hence, this paper presents STAVE - a Security Testbed for Agricultural Vehicles and Environments - as a potential solution to assist with the identification of cybersecurity vulnerabilities within commercially available off-the-shelf components used in certain agricultural systems. This paper reports ongoing research efforts to develop and refine the STAVE testbed, along with describing initial cybersecurity experimentation which aims to identify security vulnerabilities within wireless and Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus agricultural vehicle components.\nClassification and mapping of low-statured 'shrubland' cover types in post-agricultural landscapes of the US Northeast\t\"Michael J Mahoney, \n      \n      Lucas K Johnson, \n      \n      Abigail Z Guinan, \n      \n      Colin M Beier\"\t2022/12",

In the US Northeast, emergence of low-statured woody vegetation, or shrublands, instead of secondary forests in post-agricultural landscapes is well-documented by field studies, but poorly understood from a landscape perspective, which limits the ability to systematically study and manage these lands. To address gaps in classification/mapping of low-statured cover types where they have been historically rare, we developed models to predict shrubland distributions at 30m resolution across New York State (NYS), using a stacked ensemble combining a random forest, gradient boosting machine, and artificial neural network to integrate remote sensing of structural (airborne LIDAR) and optical (satellite imagery) properties of vegetation cover. We first classified a 1m canopy height model (CHM), derived from a patchwork of available LIDAR coverages, to define shrubland presence/absence. Next, these non-contiguous maps were used to train a model ensemble based on temporally-segmented imagery to predict shrubland probability for the entire study landscape (NYS). Approximately 2.5% of the CHM coverage area was classified as shrubland. Models using Landsat predictors trained on the classified CHM were effective at identifying shrubland (test set AUC=0.893, real-world AUC=0.904), in discriminating between shrub/young forest and other cover classes, and produced qualitatively sensible maps, even when extending beyond the original training data. Our results suggest that incorporation of airborne LiDAR, even from a discontinuous patchwork of coverages, can improve land cover classification of historically rare but increasingly prevalent shrubland habitats across broader areas.\nTowards assessing agricultural land suitability with causal machine learning\t\"Georgios Giannarakis, \n      \n      Vasileios Sitokonstantinou, \n      \n      Roxanne Suzette Lorilla, \n      \n      Charalampos Kontoes\"\t2022/04/27\tUnderstanding the suitability of agricultural land for applying specific management practices is of great importance for sustainable and resilient agriculture against climate change. Recent developments in the field of causal machine learning enable the estimation of intervention impacts on an outcome of interest, for samples described by a set of observed characteristics. We introduce an extensible data-driven framework that leverages earth observations and frames agricultural land suitability as a geospatial impact assessment problem, where the estimated effects of agricultural practices on agroecosystems serve as a land suitability score and guide decision making. We formulate this as a causal machine learning task and discuss how this approach can be used for agricultural planning in a changing climate. Specifically, we extract the agricultural management practices of \"crop rotation\" and \"landscape crop diversity\" from crop type maps, account for climate and land use data, and use double machine learning to estimate their heterogeneous effect on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), within the Flanders region of Belgium from 2010 to 2020. We find that the effect of crop rotation was insignificant, while landscape crop diversity had a small negative effect on NPP. Finally, we observe considerable effect heterogeneity in space for both practices and analyze it.\nFarmer's Assistant: A Machine Learning Based Application for Agricultural Solutions\t\"Shloka Gupta, \n      \n      Akshay Chopade, \n      \n      Nishit Jain, \n      \n      Aparna Bhonde\"\t2022/04/24\tFarmers face several challenges when growing crops like uncertain irrigation, poor soil quality, etc. Especially in India, a major fraction of farmers do not have the knowledge to select appropriate crops and fertilizers. Moreover, crop failure due to disease causes a significant loss to the farmers, as well as the consumers. While there have been recent developments in the automated detection of these diseases using Machine Learning techniques, the utilization of Deep Learning has not been fully explored. Additionally, such models are not easy to use because of the high-quality data used in their training, lack of computational power, and poor generalizability of the models. To this end, we create an open-source easy-to-use web application to address some of these issues which may help improve crop production. In particular, we support crop recommendation, fertilizer recommendation, plant disease prediction, and an interactive news-feed. In addition, we also use interpretability techniques in an attempt to explain the prediction made by our disease detection model.\nAugmentation Invariance and Adaptive Sampling in Semantic Segmentation of Agricultural Aerial Images\t\"Antonio Tavera, \n      \n      Edoardo Arnaudo, \n      \n      Carlo Masone, \n      \n      Barbara Caputo\"\t2022/04/17\tIn this paper, we investigate the problem of Semantic Segmentation for agricultural aerial imagery.

This partly explains why ICT has not yet had its full impact within the domain. By utilizing the vast amount of publicly available open data, ranging from topographic maps to multispectral satellite images, the economically and environmentally optimal farming practices can be advanced beyond state of the art. This paper addresses the potential of applying publicly available information sources to improve crop production, with emphasis on yield optimization. This potential is evaluated based on free public data for the growth season 2016 by examining winter wheat production for a selected region in Denmark. Data aggregation is performed by promoting opensource software tools as a foundation for decision support. That allows the farmer, or another domain expert, to query a certain crop type, merge this information with other data sets, and perform analysis on data ranging from sub-field analysis to statistics on national/regional scale. The registration of field polygons and sowed crop types for fields in Denmark, alongside with detailed geographic data and free satellite images, enable us to exploit publicly available data of high quality, which can be applied to perform further analysis.\nDisruption of a Planetary Nitrogen Cycle as Evidence of Extraterrestrial Agriculture\t\"Jacob Haqq-Misra, \n      \n      Thomas J. Fauchez, \n      \n      Edward W. Schwieterman, \n      \n      Ravi Kopparapu\"\t2022/04/11\tAgriculture is one of the oldest forms of technology on Earth. The cultivation of plants requires a terrestrial planet with active hydrological and carbon cycles and depends on the availability of nitrogen in soil. The technological innovation of agriculture is the active management of this nitrogen cycle by applying fertilizer to soil, at first through the production of manure excesses but later by the Haber-Bosch industrial process. The use of such fertilizers has increased the atmospheric abundance of nitrogen-containing species such as NH3_3 and N2_2O as agricultural productivity intensifies in many parts of the world. Both NH3_3 and N2_2O are effective greenhouse gases, and the combined presence of these gases in the atmosphere of a habitable planet could serve as a remotely detectable spectral signature of technology. Here we use a synthetic spectral generator to assess the detectability of NH3_3 and N2_2O that would arise from present-day and future global-scale agriculture. We show that present-day Earth abundances of NH3_3 and N2_2O would be difficult to detect but hypothetical scenarios involving a planet with 30-100 billion people could show a change in transmittance of about 50-70% compared to pre-agricultural Earth. These calculations suggest the possibility of considering the simultaneous detection of NH3_3 and N2_2O in an atmosphere that also contains H2_2O, O2_2, and CO2_2 as a technosignature for extraterrestrial agriculture. The technology of agriculture is one that could be sustainable across geologic timescales, so the spectral signature of such an \"ExoFarm\" is worth considering in the search for technosignatures.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks for Image Augmentation in Agriculture: A Systematic Review\t\"Ebenezer Olaniyi, \n      \n      Dong Chen, \n      \n      Yuzhen Lu, \n      \n      Yanbo Huang\"\t2022/04/12\tIn agricultural image analysis, optimal model performance is keenly pursued for better fulfilling visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, segmentation, object detection and localization), in the presence of challenges with biological variability and unstructured environments. Large-scale, balanced and ground-truthed image datasets, however, are often difficult to obtain to fuel the development of advanced, high-performance models. As artificial intelligence through deep learning is impacting analysis and modeling of agricultural images, data augmentation plays a crucial role in boosting model performance while reducing manual efforts for data preparation, by algorithmically expanding training datasets. Beyond traditional data augmentation techniques, generative adversarial network (GAN) invented in 2014 in the computer vision community, provides a suite of novel approaches that can learn good data representations and generate highly realistic samples. Since 2017, there has been a growth of research into GANs for image augmentation or synthesis in agriculture for improved model performance.

Marszalek, \n      \n      Bertrand Le Saux, \n      \n      Pierre-Philippe Mathieu, \n      \n      Artur Nowakowski, \n      \n      Daniel Springer\"\t2022/04/05\tMachine learning, satellites or local sensors are key factors for a sustainable and resource-saving optimisation of agriculture and proved its values for the management of agricultural land. Up to now, the main focus was on the enlargement of data which were evaluated by means of supervised learning methods. Nevertheless, the need for labels is also a limiting and time-consuming factor, while in contrast, ongoing technological development is already providing an ever-increasing amount of unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) could overcome this limitation and incorporate existing unlabeled data. Therefore, a crop type data set was utilized to conduct experiments with SSL and compare it to supervised methods. A unique feature of our data set from 2016 to 2018 was a divergent climatological condition in 2018 that reduced yields and affected the spectral fingerprint of the plants. Our experiments focused on predicting 2018 using SLL without or a few labels to clarify whether new labels should be collected for an unknown year. Despite these challenging conditions, the results showed that SSL contributed to higher accuracies. We believe that the results will encourage further improvements in the field of precision farming, why the SSL framework and data will be published (Marszalek, 2021).\nDevelopment of a Scale to Measure Technology Acceptance in Smart Agriculture\t\"Rosemary J Thomas, \n      \n      Rebecca Whetton, \n      \n      Andy Doyle, \n      \n      David Coyle\"\t2022/03/29\tThis paper describes the development of a scale to measure technology acceptance in smart agriculture. The scale is intended for use in diverse situations, ranging for the evaluation of existing technologies already in widespread use, to the evaluation of prototype systems. A systematic screening of prior literature was conducted to identify initial scale items regarding how technology acceptance is currently understood and measured. These items were iteratively reviewed and systematically categorised to develop the final scale proposed in this paper. In future work, this scale will be validated through user studies. The purpose of this paper is to make the initial scale available to the research community with a view to initial use and further evaluation.\nInvestigating End-Users' Values in Agriculture Mobile Applications Development: An Empirical Study on Bangladeshi Female Farmers\t\"Rifat Ara Shams, \n      \n      Mojtaba Shahin, \n      \n      Gillian Oliver, \n      \n      Harsha Perera, \n      \n      Jon Whittle, \n      \n      Arif Nurwidyantoro, \n      \n      Waqar Hussain\"\t2022/03/19\tThe omnipresent nature of mobile applications (apps) in all aspects of daily lives raises the necessity of reflecting end-users values (e.g., fairness, honesty, etc.) in apps. However, there are limited considerations of end-users values in apps development. Value violations by apps have been reported in the media and are responsible for end-users dissatisfaction and negative socio-economic consequences. Value violations may bring more severe and lasting problems for marginalized and vulnerable end-users of apps, which have been explored less (if at all) in the software engineering community. However, understanding the values of the end-users of apps is the essential first step towards values-based apps development. This research aims to fill this gap by investigating the human values of Bangladeshi female farmers as a marginalized and vulnerable group of end-users of Bangladeshi agriculture apps. We conducted an empirical study that collected and analyzed data from a survey with 193 Bangladeshi female farmers to explore the underlying factor structure of the values of Bangladeshi female farmers and the significance of demographics on their values. The results identified three underlying factors of Bangladeshi female farmers. The first factor comprises of five values: benevolence, security, conformity, universalism, and tradition. The second factor consists of two values: self-direction and stimulation. The third factor includes three values: power, achievement, and hedonism. We also identified strong influences of demographics on some of the values of Bangladeshi female farmers. For example, area has significant impacts on three values: hedonism, achievement, and tradition. Similarly, there are also strong influences of household income on power and security.\nTowards On-Device AI and Blockchain for 6G enabled Agricultural Supply-chain Management\t\"Muhammad Zawish, \n      \n      Nouman Ashraf, \n      \n      Rafay Iqbal Ansari, \n      \n      Steven Davy, \n      \n      Hassan Khaliq Qureshi, \n      \n      Nauman Aslam, \n      \n      Syed Ali Hassan\"\t2022/03/12\t6G envisions artificial intelligence (AI) powered solutions for enhancing the quality-of-service (QoS) in the network and to ensure optimal utilization of resources.

In this work, we propose an architecture based on the combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), AI and blockchain for agricultural supply-chain management with the purpose of ensuring traceability, transparency, tracking inventories and contracts. We propose a solution to facilitate on-device AI by generating a roadmap of models with various resource-accuracy trade-offs. A fully convolutional neural network (FCN) model is used for biomass estimation through images captured by the UAV. Instead of a single compressed FCN model for deployment on UAV, we motivate the idea of iterative pruning to provide multiple task-specific models with various complexities and accuracy. To alleviate the impact of flight failure in a 6G enabled dynamic UAV network, the proposed model selection strategy will assist UAVs to update the model based on the runtime resource requirements.\nRender-in-the-loop aerial robotics simulator: Case Study on Yield Estimation in Indoor Agriculture\t\"Antun Ivanovic, \n      \n      Marsela Polic, \n      \n      Jelena Tabak, \n      \n      Matko Orsag\"\t2022/03/01\tInspired by recent promising results in sim-to-real transfer in deep learning we built a realistic simulation environment combining a Robot Operating System (ROS)-compatible physics simulator (Gazebo) with Cycles, the realistic production rendering engine from Blender. The proposed simulator pipeline allows us to simulate near-realistic RGB-D images. To showcase the capabilities of the simulator pipeline we propose a case study that focuses on indoor robotic farming. We developed a solution for sweet pepper yield estimation task. Our approach to yield estimation starts with aerial robotics control and trajectory planning, combined with deep learning-based pepper detection, and a clustering approach for counting fruit. The results of this case study show that we can combine real time dynamic simulation with near realistic rendering capabilities to simulate complex robotic systems.\nExperimental observations on interaction between a root and droplets in relation to aeroponic agriculture\t\"Tejas Narasegowda, \n      \n      Navneet Kumar\"\t2022/02/17\tAeroponics or Soil-less agriculture is a relatively new and recent type of practice, where plants are grown without soil while nutrient-rich water is provided via an atomized spray system to the suspended roots. Spray nozzles are easy-to-use in supplying water (and fertilizers) to (mainly) the roots and root hairs of the desired crop (or plant) for production. We characterize a spray nozzle delivering water vertically above against the gravity by measuring, experimentally, its (a) spray drift, (b) spray height, (c) maximum spray angle, (d) spray width, and (e) droplets sizes. Experiments were carried out at different inlet pressures and a majority of the above mentioned parameters were obtained by processing the images captured using optical (or high speed) camera, sometimes along a plane lighted by a high-power laser source. We also studied the spray (or jet) behaviour at different vertical heights and different horizontal planes using a unique polythene sponge method. We studied the mass flow rate, the absorption rate, and droplet size dynamics (as a function of time and pressure) using this method. The water drop/droplet interaction was also studied in the case of simpler porous and impervious surfaces as well. We believe that this study can be extrapolated to other nozzles (especially sprays) to obtain similar characteristic parameters. This study, hence, is critical in selecting the desired spray system for a given canopy and is also expected to be of some use in controlled agricultural practices such as in greenhouses and apartment rooms.\nInformation and communication technology initiatives for knowledge sharing in agriculture\tSiddhartha Paul Tiwari\t2022/02/17\tA survey on status and trends of information and communication technologies (ICT) use for knowledge sharing in agriculture was attempted. Among asian countries, India comes under the second next category after the advanced user category comprising Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Both profit-motive and business augmentation on one hand and community services and rural welfare on the other have been the objectives of ICT-based models in agriculture in India. The ICT endeavours for agriculture belong to a wide array of agencies, viz private sector, public sector, self-help groups and NGOs, and also include combined endeavours. e-Learning is being increasingly resorted to both in (i) in campus or 'presence' mode, and (ii) 'distance' mode. Its use is gradually easing-out the stakeholders from the stranglehold of the inter-deterrence of the 3 arms of the 'Iron Triangle', viz (i) quality, (ii) access, and (iii) cost. The social groups having less mobility are poised to benefit more from this mode of education. This could also be one of the potent tools to bring about gender mainstreaming. e-Learning is being integrated into the existing organizational and educational structure as a hybrid system that can be called 'ICT-supported learning'. Connectivity, content development, infrastructure development, faculty developmeat, need assessment on a continuum, linking the node3 and formation of consortia etc. are the areas identified that need to be supported and developed.\nAgricultural Windfalls and the Seasonality of Political Violence in Africa\t\"David Ubilava, \n      \n      Justin V.

Hastings, \n      \n      Kadir Atalay\"\t2022/10/26\tWhen the prices of cereal grains rise, social unrest and conflict become likely. In rural areas, the predation motives of perpetrators can explain the positive relationship between prices and conflict. Predation happens at places and in periods where and when spoils to be appropriated are available. In predominantly agrarian societies, such opportune times align with the harvest season. Does the seasonality of agricultural income lead to the seasonality of conflict? We address this question by analyzing over 55 thousand incidents involving violence against civilians staged by paramilitary groups across Africa during the 1997-2020 period. We investigate the crop year pattern of violence in response to agricultural income shocks via changes in international cereal prices. We find that a year-on-year one standard deviation annual growth of the price of the major cereal grain results in a harvest-time spike in violence by militias in a one-degree cell where this cereal grain is grown. This translates to a nearly ten percent increase in violence during the early postharvest season. We observe no such change in violence by state forces or rebel groups--the other two notable actors. By further investigating the mechanisms, we show that the violence by militias is amplified after plausibly rich harvest seasons when the value of spoils to be appropriated is higher. By focusing on harvest-related seasonality of conflict, as well as actors more likely to be involved in violence against civilians, we contribute to the growing literature on the economic causes of conflict in predominantly agrarian societies.\nAgricultural quality matrix-based multiomics structural analysis of carrots in soils fertilized with thermophile-fermented compost\t\"Hirokuni Miyamoto, \n      \n      Katsumi Shigeta, \n      \n      Wataru Suda, \n      \n      Yasunori Ichihashi, \n      \n      Naoto Nihei, \n      \n      Makiko Matsuura, \n      \n      Arisa Tsuboi, \n      \n      Naoki Tominaga, \n      \n      Masahiko Aono, \n      \n      Muneo Sato, \n      \n      Shunya Taguchi, \n      \n      Teruno Nakaguma, \n      \n      Naoko Tsuji, \n      \n      Chitose Ishii, \n      \n      Teruo Matsushita, \n      \n      Chie Shindo, \n      \n      Toshiaki Ito, \n      \n      Tamotsu Kato, \n      \n      Hiroshi Ohno, \n      \n      Atsushi Kurotani, \n      \n      Hideaki Shima, \n      \n      Shigeharu Moriya, \n      \n      Sankichi Horiuchi, \n      \n      Takashi Satoh, \n      \n      Kenichi Mori\n      , et al. (6 additional authors not shown)\"\t2023/03/31\tCompost is used worldwide as a soil conditioner for crops, but its functions have still been explored. Here, the omics profiles of carrots were investigated, as a root vegetable plant model, in a field amended with compost fermented with thermophilic Bacillaceae for growth and quality indices. Exposure to compost significantly increased the productivity, antioxidant activity, red color, and taste of the carrot root and altered the soil bacterial composition with the levels of characteristic metabolites of the leaf, root, and soil. Based on the data, structural equation modeling (SEM) estimated that L-2-aminoadipate, phenylalanine, flavonoids and / or carotenoids in plants were optimally linked by exposure to compost. The SEM of the soil estimated that the genus Paenibacillus, L-2-aminoadipate and nicotinamide, and S-methyl L-cysteine were optimally involved during exposure. These estimates did not show a contradiction between the whole genomic analysis of compost-derived Paenibacillus isolates and the bioactivity data, inferring the presence of a complex cascade of plant growth-promoting effects and modulation of the nitrogen cycle by compost itself. These observations have provided information on the qualitative indicators of compost in complex soil-plant interactions and offer a new perspective for chemically independent sustainable agriculture through the efficient use of natural nitrogen.\nTIML: Task-Informed Meta-Learning for Agriculture\t\"Gabriel Tseng, \n      \n      Hannah Kerner, \n      \n      David Rolnick\"\t2022/02/04\tLabeled datasets for agriculture are extremely spatially imbalanced. When developing algorithms for data-sparse regions, a natural approach is to use transfer learning from data-rich regions. While standard transfer learning approaches typically leverage only direct inputs and outputs, geospatial imagery and agricultural data are rich in metadata that can inform transfer learning algorithms, such as the spatial coordinates of data-points or the class of task being learned. We build on previous work exploring the use of meta-learning for agricultural contexts in data-sparse regions and introduce task-informed meta-learning (TIML), an augmentation to model-agnostic meta-learning which takes advantage of task-specific metadata. We apply TIML to crop type classification and yield estimation, and find that TIML significantly improves performance compared to a range of benchmarks in both contexts, across a diversity of model architectures. While we focus on tasks from agriculture, TIML could offer benefits to any meta-learning setup with task-specific metadata, such as classification of geo-tagged images and species distribution modelling.\nSTRIDE-based Cyber Security Threat Modeling for IoT-enabled Precision Agriculture Systems\t\"Md.

A recent projection shows that the world is lagging behind accomplishing the \"Zero Hunger\" goal, in spite of some advancements. Socio-economic and well being fallout will affect the food security. Vulnerable groups of people will suffer malnutrition. To cater to the needs of the increasing population, the agricultural industry needs to be modernized, become smart, and automated. Traditional agriculture can be remade to efficient, sustainable, eco-friendly smart agriculture by adopting existing technologies. In this survey paper the authors present the applications, technological trends, available datasets, networking options, and challenges in smart agriculture. How Agro Cyber Physical Systems are built upon the Internet-of-Agro-Things is discussed through various application fields. Agriculture 4.0 is also discussed as a whole. We focus on the technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) which support the automation, along with the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which provides data integrity and security. After an in-depth study of different architectures, we also present a smart agriculture framework which relies on the location of data processing. We have divided open research problems of smart agriculture as future research work in two groups - from a technological perspective and from a networking perspective. AI, ML, the blockchain as a DLT, and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) based hardware security fall under the technology group, whereas any network related attacks, fake data injection and similar threats fall under the network research problem group.\nAgricultural Plant Cataloging and Establishment of a Data Framework from UAV-based Crop Images by Computer Vision\t\"Maurice Günder, \n      \n      Facundo R.

In large-scale experiments, however, UAV images suffer from containing a multitudinous amount of crops in a complex canopy architecture. Especially for the observation of temporal effects, this complicates the recognition of individual plants over several images and the extraction of relevant information tremendously. In this work, we present a hands-on workflow for the automatized temporal and spatial identification and individualization of crop images from UAVs abbreviated as \"cataloging\" based on comprehensible computer vision methods. We evaluate the workflow on two real-world datasets. One dataset is recorded for observation of Cercospora leaf spot - a fungal disease - in sugar beet over an entire growing cycle. The other one deals with harvest prediction of cauliflower plants. The plant catalog is utilized for the extraction of single plant images seen over multiple time points. This gathers large-scale spatio-temporal image dataset that in turn can be applied to train further machine learning models including various data layers. The presented approach improves analysis and interpretation of UAV data in agriculture significantly. By validation with some reference data, our method shows an accuracy that is similar to more complex deep learning-based recognition techniques. Our workflow is able to automatize plant cataloging and training image extraction, especially for large datasets.\nThe effect of biologically mediated decay rates on modelling soil carbon sequestration in agricultural settings\t\"Mohammad Javad Davoudabadi, \n      \n      Daniel Pagendam, \n      \n      Christopher Drovandi, \n      \n      Jeff Baldock, \n      \n      Gentry White\"\t2022/01/05\tMicrobial biomass carbon (MBC), a crucial soil labile carbon fraction, is the most active component of the soil organic carbon (SOC) that regulates bio-geochemical processes in terrestrial ecosystems.

In this study, we explore the effect of microbial population growth on the accuracy of modelling soil carbon sequestration by developing and comparing two soil carbon models that consider a carrying capacity and limit to the growth of the microbial pool. We apply our models to three datasets, two small and one large datasets, and we select the best model in terms of having the best predictive performance through two model selection methods. Through this analysis we reveal that commonly used complex soil carbon models can over-fit in the presence of both small and large time-series datasets, and our simpler model can produce more accurate predictions. We conclude that considering the microbial population growth in a soil carbon model improves the accuracy of a model in the presence of a large dataset.\nAn Ontological Knowledge Representation for Smart Agriculture\t\"Bikram Pratim Bhuyan, \n      \n      Ravi Tomar, \n      \n      Maanak Gupta, \n      \n      Amar Ramdane-Cherif\"\t2021/12/21\tIn order to provide the agricultural industry with the infrastructure it needs to take advantage of advanced technology, such as big data, the cloud, and the internet of things (IoT); smart farming is a management concept that focuses on providing the infrastructure necessary to track, monitor, automate, and analyse operations.

Unlike other natural disasters, droughts have a slow onset and depend on various external factors, making drought detection in climate data difficult. In contrast to existing works that rely on simple relative drought indices as ground-truth data, we build upon soil moisture index (SMI) obtained from a hydrological model. This index is directly related to insufficiently available water to vegetation. Given ERA5-Land climate input data of six months with land use information from MODIS satellite observation, we compare different models with and without sequential inductive bias in classifying droughts based on SMI. We use PR-AUC as the evaluation measure to account for the class imbalance and obtain promising results despite a challenging time-based split. We further show in an ablation study that the models retain their predictive capabilities given input data of coarser resolutions, as frequently encountered in climate models.\nCognitive factors that affect the adoption of autonomous agriculture\tS. K. Devitt\t2021/11/28\tRobotic and Autonomous Agricultural Technologies (RAAT) are increasingly available yet may fail to be adopted. This paper focusses specifically on cognitive factors that affect adoption including: inability to generate trust, loss of farming knowledge and reduced social cognition. It is recommended that agriculture develops its own framework for the performance and safety of RAAT drawing on human factors research in aerospace engineering including human inputs (individual variance in knowledge, skills, abilities, preferences, needs and traits), trust, situational awareness and cognitive load. The kinds of cognitive impacts depend on the RAATs level of autonomy, ie whether it has automatic, partial autonomy and autonomous functionality and stage of adoption, ie adoption, initial use or post-adoptive use. The more autonomous a system is, the less a human needs to know to operate it and the less the cognitive load, but it also means farmers have less situational awareness about on farm activities that in turn may affect strategic decision-making about their enterprise. Some cognitive factors may be hidden when RAAT is first adopted but play a greater role during prolonged or intense post-adoptive use. Systems with partial autonomy need intuitive user interfaces, engaging system information, and clear signaling to be trusted with low level tasks; and to compliment and augment high order decision-making on farm.\nVisualization and Attack Prevention for a Sensor-Based Agricultural Monitoring System\t\"Yifan Zhou, \n      \n      Zhendong Shi, \n      \n      Ruoxi Sun\"\t2021/11/27\tThis project proposes a sensor-based visual agricultural monitoring system.

Thus, we introduce our living lab ORPHEUS and its design and implementation trajectory to showcase our orchestrated testbed of IoT sensors, data connectivity, database orchestration, and visualization dashboard. We deploy light-weight energy saving SNs in the field to collect data, using LoRa (Long Range wireless) to transmit data from the SNs to the Gateway node, upload all the data to the database server, and finally visualize the data. For future exploration, we also built a testbed of embedded devices using four different variants of NVIDIA Jetson development modules (Nano, TX2, Xavier NX, AGX Xavier) to benchmark the potential upgrade choices for SNs in ORPHEUS. Based on our deployment in multiple farms in a 3-county region around Purdue University, and on the Purdue University campus, we present analyses from our living lab deployment and additional components of the next-generation IoT farm.\nPublic Policymaking for International Agricultural Trade using Association Rules and Ensemble Machine Learning\t\"Feras A. Batarseh, \n      \n      Munisamy Gopinath, \n      \n      Anderson Monken, \n      \n      Zhengrong Gu\"\t2021/11/14\tInternational economics has a long history of improving our understanding of factors causing trade, and the consequences of free flow of goods and services across countries. The recent shocks to the free trade regime, especially trade disputes among major economies, as well as black swan events, such as trade wars and pandemics, raise the need for improved predictions to inform policy decisions. AI methods are allowing economists to solve such prediction problems in new ways. In this manuscript, we present novel methods that predict and associate food and agricultural commodities traded internationally. Association Rules (AR) analysis has been deployed successfully for economic scenarios at the consumer or store level, such as for market basket analysis. In our work however, we present analysis of imports and exports associations and their effects on commodity trade flows. Moreover, Ensemble Machine Learning methods are developed to provide improved agricultural trade predictions, outlier events' implications, and quantitative pointers to policy makers.\nCombining expert knowledge and neural networks to model environmental stresses in agriculture\t\"Kostadin Cvejoski, \n      \n      Jannis Schuecker, \n      \n      Anne-Katrin Mahlein, \n      \n      Bogdan Georgiev\"\t2021/10/26\tIn this work we combine representation learning capabilities of neural network with agricultural knowledge from experts to model environmental heat and drought stresses.

Digital Green (DG) is one such ICT that employs a participatory approach with smallholder farmers to produce instructional videos that encompass content specific to them. With help of human mediators, they disseminate these videos using projectors to improve the adoption of agricultural practices. DG's web-based data tracker stores attendance and adoption logs of millions of farmers, videos screened and their demographic information. We leverage this data for a period of ten years between 2010-2020 across five states in India and use it to conduct a holistic evaluation of the ICT. First, we find disparities in adoption rates of farmers, following which we use statistical tests to identify different factors that lead to these disparities and gender-based inequalities. Second, to provide assistance to farmers facing challenges, we model the adoption of practices from a video as a prediction problem and experiment with different model architectures. Our classifier achieves accuracies ranging from 79% to 90% across the five states, demonstrating its potential for assisting future ethnographic investigations. Third, we use SHAP values in conjunction with our model for explaining the impact of various network, content and demographic features on adoption. Our research finds that farmers greatly benefit from past adopters of a video from their group and village. We also discover that videos with a low content-specificity benefit some farmers more than others. Next, we highlight the implications of our findings by translating them into recommendations for community building, revisiting participatory approach and mitigating inequalities. We conclude with a discussion on how our work can assist future investigations into the lived experiences of farmers.\nDeepAg: Deep Learning Approach for Measuring the Effects of Outlier Events on Agricultural Production and Policy\t\"Sai Gurrapu, \n      \n      Feras A.

Sudden shocks in these processes caused by outlier events such as trade wars, pandemics, or weather can have complex effects on the global economy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely: DeepAg, that employs econometrics and measures the effects of outlier events detection using Deep Learning (DL) to determine relationships between commonplace financial indices (such as the DowJones), and the production values of agricultural commodities (such as Cheese and Milk). We employed a DL technique called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks successfully to predict commodity production with high accuracy and also present five popular models (regression and boosting) as baselines to measure the effects of outlier events. The results indicate that DeepAg with outliers' considerations (using Isolation Forests) outperforms baseline models, as well as the same model without outliers detection. Outlier events make a considerable impact when predicting commodity production with respect to financial indices. Moreover, we present the implications of DeepAg on public policy, provide insights for policymakers and farmers, and for operational decisions in the agricultural ecosystem. Data are collected, models developed, and the results are recorded and presented.\nAnalysis of Indian Agricultural Ecosystem using Knowledge-based Tantra Framework\t\"Shreekanth M Prabhu, \n      \n      Natarajan Subramanyam\"\t2021/10/13\tThe information systems have been extremely useful in managing businesses, enterprises, and public institutions such as government departments. But current challenges are increasingly about managing ecosystems. Ecosystem is a useful paradigm to better understand a variety of domains such as biology, business, industry, agriculture, and society. In this paper, we look at the Indian Agricultural ecosystem. It is a mammoth task to assimilate the information for the whole ecosystem consisting of consumers, producers, workers, traders, transporters, industry, and Government. There are myriad interventions by the state and the central Governments, whose efficacy is difficult to track and the outcomes hard to assess. A policy intervention that helps one part of the ecosystem can harm the other. In addition, sustainability and ecological considerations are also extremely important. In this paper, we make use of the Knowledge-based Tantra Social Information Management Framework to analyze the Indian Agricultural Ecosystem and build related Knowledge Graphs. Our analysis spans descriptive, normative, and transformative viewpoints. Tantra Framework makes use of concepts from Zachman Framework to manage aspects of social information through different perspectives and concepts from Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) to represent interrelationships between aspects.\nHuman Values in Mobile App Development: An Empirical Study on Bangladeshi Agriculture Mobile Apps\t\"Rifat Ara Shams, \n      \n      Mojtaba Shahin, \n      \n      Gillian Oliver, \n      \n      Jon Whittle, \n      \n      Waqar Hussain, \n      \n      Harsha Perera, \n      \n      Arif Nurwidyantoro\"\t2021/10/11\tGiven the ubiquity of mobile applications (apps) in daily lives, understanding and reflecting end-users' human values (e.g., transparency, privacy, social recognition etc.) in apps has become increasingly important. Violations of end users' values by software applications have been reported in the media and have resulted in a wide range of difficulties for end users. Value violations may bring more and lasting problems for marginalized and vulnerable groups of end-users. This research aims to understand the extent to which the values of Bangladeshi female farmers, marginalized and vulnerable end-users, who are less studied by the software engineering community, are reflected in agriculture apps in Bangladesh. Further to this, we aim to identify possible strategies to embed their values in those apps. To this end, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study consisting of 13 interviews with app practitioners and four focus groups with 20 Bangladeshi female farmers. The accumulated results from the interviews and focus groups identified 22 values of Bangladeshi female farmers, which the participants expect to be reflected in the agriculture apps. Among these 22 values, 15 values (e.g., accuracy, independence) are already reflected and 7 values (e.g., accessibility, pleasure) are ignored/violated in the existing agriculture apps. We also identified 14 strategies (e.g., \"applying human-centered approaches to elicit values\", \"establishing a dedicated team/person for values concerns\") to address Bangladeshi female farmers' values in agriculture apps.\nPlant-Protein-Enabled Biodegradable Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Sustainable Agriculture\t\"Chengmei Jiang, \n      \n      Chengxin He, \n      \n      Qi Zhang, \n      \n      Chi Zhang, \n      \n      Xiaohui Feng, \n      \n      Xunjia Li, \n      \n      Qiang Zhao, \n      \n      Yibin Ying, \n      \n      Jianfeng Ping\"\t2021/10/05\tAs the use of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) increases, the generation of related electronic waste has been a major challenge.

One exciting application domain for such technologies is precision agriculture, where the ability to integrate on-board machine vision with data-driven actuation means that farmers can make decisions about crop care and harvesting at the level of the individual plant rather than the whole field. This makes sense both economically and environmentally. However, the key driver for this capability is fast and robust machine vision -- typically driven by machine learning (ML) solutions and dependent on accurate modelling. One critical challenge is that the bulk of ML-based vision research considers only metrics that evaluate the accuracy of object detection and do not assess practical factors. This paper introduces three metrics that highlight different aspects relevant for real-world deployment of precision weeding and demonstrates their utility through experimental results.\nMulti-Domain Few-Shot Learning and Dataset for Agricultural Applications\t\"Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati, \n      \n      Anirudh Tunga\"\t2021/09/21\t\"Automatic classification of pests and plants (both healthy and diseased) is of paramount importance in agriculture to improve yield. Conventional deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks require thousands of labeled examples per category. In this work we propose a method to learn from a few samples to automatically classify different pests, plants, and their diseases, using Few-Shot Learning (FSL). We learn a feature extractor to generate embeddings and then update the embeddings using Transformers. Using Mahalanobis distance, a class-covariance-based metric, we then calculate the similarity of the transformed embeddings with the embedding of the image to be classified. Using our proposed architecture, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets showing the effectiveness of our proposed model. We conduct 42 experiments in total to comprehensively analyze the model and it achieves up to 14% and 24% performance gains on few-shot image classification benchmarks on two datasets.\n  We also compile a new FSL dataset containing images of healthy and diseased plants taken in real-world settings. Using our proposed architecture which has been shown to outperform several existing FSL architectures in agriculture, we provide strong baselines on our newly proposed dataset.\"\nTowards agricultural autonomy: crop row detection under varying field conditions using deep learning\t\"Rajitha de Silva, \n      \n      Grzegorz Cielniak, \n      \n      Junfeng Gao\"\t2021/09/16\tThis paper presents a novel metric to evaluate the robustness of deep learning based semantic segmentation approaches for crop row detection under different field conditions encountered by a field robot. A dataset with ten main categories encountered under various field conditions was used for testing. The effect on these conditions on the angular accuracy of crop row detection was compared. A deep convolutional encoder decoder network is implemented to predict crop row masks using RGB input images. The predicted mask is then sent to a post processing algorithm to extract the crop rows. The deep learning model was found to be robust against shadows and growth stages of the crop while the performance was reduced under direct sunlight, increasing weed density, tramlines and discontinuities in crop rows when evaluated with the novel metric.\nNavigational Path-Planning For All-Terrain Autonomous Agricultural Robot\t\"Vedant Ghodke, \n      \n      Jyoti Madake\"\t2021/09/07\tThe shortage of workforce and increasing cost of maintenance has forced many farm industrialists to shift towards automated and mechanized approaches. The key component for autonomous systems is the path planning techniques used. Coverage path planning (CPP) algorithm is used for navigating over farmlands to perform various agricultural operations such as seeding, ploughing, or spraying pesticides and fertilizers. This report paper compares novel algorithms for autonomous navigation of farmlands. For reduction of navigational constraints, a high-resolution grid map representation is taken into consideration specific to Indian environments. The free space is covered by distinguishing the grid cells as covered, unexplored, partially explored and presence of an obstacle. The performance of the compared algorithms is evaluated with metrics such as time efficiency, space efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to changes in the environment. Robotic Operating System (ROS), Dassault Systemes Experience Platform (3DS Experience), MATLAB along Python were used for the simulation of the compared algorithms. The results proved the applicability of the algorithms for autonomous field navigation and feasibility with robotic path planning.\nLand use change in agricultural systems: an integrated ecological-social simulation model of farmer decisions and cropping system performance based on a cellular automata approach\t\"Diego Ferraro, \n      \n      Daniela Blanco, \n      \n      Sebastián Pessah, \n      \n      Rodrigo Castro\"\t2021/09/04\tAgricultural systems experience land-use changes that are driven by population growth and intensification of",

This results in land-use and cover change (LUCC) dynamics representing a complex landscape transformation process. In order to study the LUCC process we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model in the form of a Cellular Automata implemented with the Cell-DEVS formalism. The resulting model called AgroDEVS is used for predicting LUCC dynamics along with their associated economic and environmental changes. AgroDEVS is structured using behavioral rules and functions representing a) crop yields, b) weather conditions, c) economic profit, d) farmer preferences, e) technology level adoption and f) natural resources consumption based on embodied energy accounting. Using data from a typical location of the Pampa region (Argentina) for the 1988-2015 period, simulation exercises showed that the economic goals were achieved, on average, each 6 out of 10 years, but the environmental thresholds were only achieved in 1.9 out of 10 years. In a set of 50-years simulations, LUCC patterns quickly converge towards the most profitable crop sequences, with no noticeable tradeoff between the economic and environmental conditions.\nA review of effects of climate change on Agriculture in Africa\t\"Samuel Asante Gyamerah, \n      \n      Dennis Ikpe\"\t2021/08/25\tCurrently, agriculture in Africa contributes only a tenth to global Green House Gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. Despite its relatively low contribution to GHG, a conundrum of \"climate justice\", adverse impacts of climate change disproportionately threaten Africa's agriculture, the Continent's main economic sector. Consequently, we seek to review the effects of climate change on Agriculture.\nReadiness of the South African Agricultural Sector to Implement IoT\t\"In'aam Soeker, \n      \n      Shallen Lusinga, \n      \n      Wallace Chigona\"\t2021/08/23\tAs the world's population increases, so does the demand for food. This demand for food in turn puts pressure on agriculture in many countries. The impact of climate change on the environment has made it difficult to produce food that may be necessary to accommodate the growing population. Due to these concerns, the agriculture sector is forced to move towards more efficient and sustainable methods of farming to increase productivity. There is evidence that the use of technology in agriculture has the potential to improve food production and food sustainability; thereby addressing the concerns of food security. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been suggested as a potential tool for farmers to overcome the impact of climate change on food security. However, there is dearth of research on the readiness of implementing IoT in South Africa's agricultural sector. Therefore, this research aims to explore the readiness of the agricultural sector of South Africa for a wide implementation of IoT. This research conducts a desktop study through the lens of the PEST framework on the special case of South Africa. A thematic literature and documents review was deployed to examine the political, economic, societal and technological factors that may facilitate or impede the implementation of IoT in the agricultural sectors of South Africa. The findings suggest that the wide ranging political, economic, societal and technological constructs enable the implementation of IoT within South Africa's agricultural sector. The most important include current policies, technological infrastructure, access to internet, and mobile technology which places South Africa in a good position to implement IoT in agriculture.\nTowards a Resilient Information System for Agriculture Extension Information Service: An Exploratory Study\t\"Muluneh Atinaf, \n      \n      Alemayehu Molla, \n      \n      Salehu Anteneh\"\t2021/08/22\tAlthough digital technologies are contributing to human development, several information systems (IS) interventions for development especially in developing countries do not perform as expected nor deliver anticipated outcomes at scale. This raises questions about how to develop and enhance resilient IS for development, an area that requires more research attention. A sound and systematic understanding of the mechanisms local communities apply to maintain resilience and the key transformation areas for a resilient IS development will help to improve the situation. This study addresses how stakeholders can ensure resilient information provision within the Agricultural Extension Information Service (AEIS) and identifies the challenges in designing resilient IS. Conceptually, the study draws from the IS resilience framework. Empirically, it draws from interview data collected from the AEIS provision practice in Ethiopia. The findings show the robustness, self-organization, learning, redundancy, rapidity, scale, diversity and equality mechanisms, the challenges and the key transformations required to advance the resilience of IS for AEIS. The study contributes to the conversation on the application of the IS resilience framework in analyzing local information provision practices as well as to practice highlighting the key transformation areas to improve the effectiveness and impact of AEIS.\nPresenting an extensive lab- and field-image dataset of crops and weeds for computer vision tasks in agriculture\t\"Michael A.

The first dataset encompasses as the day of writing over 1.2 million images of indoor-grown crops and weeds common to the Canadian Prairies and many US states. The second dataset consists of over 540,000 images of plants imaged in farmland. All indoor plant images are labelled by species and we provide rich etadata on the level of individual images. This comprehensive database allows to filter the datasets under user-defined specifications such as for example the crop-type or the age of the plant. Furthermore, the indoor dataset contains images of plants taken from a wide variety of angles, including profile shots, top-down shots, and angled perspectives. The images taken from plants in fields are all from a top-down perspective and contain usually multiple plants per image. For these images metadata is also available. In this paper we describe both datasets' characteristics with respect to plant variety, plant age, and number of images. We further introduce an open-access sample of the indoor-dataset that contains 1,000 images of each species covered in our dataset. These, in total 14,000 images, had been selected, such that they form a representative sample with respect to plant age and ndividual plants per species. This sample serves as a quick entry point for new users to the dataset, allowing them to explore the data on a small scale and find the parameters of data most useful for their application without having to deal with hundreds of thousands of individual images.\nAgricultural Growth Diagnostics: Identifying the Binding Constraints and Policy Remedies for Bihar, India\t\"Elumalai Kannan, \n      \n      Sanjib Pohit\"\t2021/08/09\tAgriculture plays a significant role in economic development of the underdeveloped region. Multiple factors influence the performance of agricultural sector but a few of these have a strong bearing on its growth. We develop a growth diagnostics framework for agricultural sector in Bihar located in eastern India to identify the most binding constraints. Our results show that poor functioning of agricultural markets and low level of crop diversification are the important reasons for lower agricultural growth in Bihar. Rise in the level of instability in the prices of agricultural produces indicates a weak price transmission across the markets even after repealing the agricultural produce market committee act. Poor market linkages and non-functioning producer collectives at village level affect the farmers motivation for undertaking crop diversification. Our policy suggestions include state provision of basic market infrastructure to attract private investment in agricultural marketing, strengthening the farmer producer organisations, and a comprehensive policy on crop diversification.\nEnergy management strategy for an optimum control of a standalone photovoltaic-batteries water pumping system for agriculture applications\t\"Mohammed Benzaouia, \n      \n      Hajji Bekkay, \n      \n      Abdelhamid Rabhi, \n      \n      Adel Mellit, \n      \n      Benslimane Anas, \n      \n      Anne Migan-Dubois\"\t2021/08/05\tPumping water using multiple energy sources is the ideal solution for supplying of potable water in isolated or arid areas. In this paper, an effective control and energy management strategy for a stand-alone photovoltaic-batteries water pumping system for agriculture applications is presented. The system is composed of photovoltaic solar panels as primary energy sources, and Lead-Acid batteries as seconder energy sources to supply the brushless DC motor and the centrifugal pump. The energy management strategy uses an intelligent algorithm to satisfy the energy demanded by the motor, also to maintain the state-of-charge of the battery between safe margins in order to eliminate the full discharge and the destruction of the batteries. Drift is a major problem in photovoltaic systems; this phenomenon occurs when the solar irradiation changes rapidly. Classical MPPT algorithms do not solve this problem, for this reason a modified P\\&O has been implemented, the obtained results shown the efficiency of the algorithm compared to the conventional P\\&O. Computer simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed energy management algorithm under random meteorological conditions.\nAutomated Pest Detection with DNN on the Edge for Precision Agriculture\t\"Andrea Albanese, \n      \n      Matteo Nardello, \n      \n      Davide Brunelli\"\t2021/08/01\tArtificial intelligence has smoothly penetrated several economic activities, especially monitoring and control applications, including the agriculture sector. However, research efforts toward low-power sensing devices with fully functional machine learning (ML) on-board are still fragmented and limited in smart farming. Biotic stress is one of the primary causes of crop yield reduction. With the development of deep learning in computer vision technology, autonomous detection of pest infestation through images has become an important research direction for timely crop disease diagnosis. This paper presents an embedded system enhanced with ML functionalities, ensuring continuous detection of pest infestation inside fruit orchards. The embedded solution is based on a low-power embedded sensing system along with a Neural Accelerator able to capture and process images inside common pheromone-based traps. Three different ML algorithms have been trained and deployed, highlighting the capabilities of the platform. Moreover, the proposed approach guarantees an extended battery life thanks to the integration of energy harvesting functionalities. Results show how it is possible to automate the task of pest infestation for unlimited time without the farmer's intervention.\nTemplate-based Chatbot for Agriculture Related FAQs\t\"Daping Zhang, \n      \n      Xin Chen, \n      \n      Yujia Zhang, \n      \n      Shihan Qin\"\t2021/07/29\tAgriculture is the fundamental industry of the society, which is the basis of food supply and an important source of employment and GDP increase.

Near-ground sensors provide valuable information, yet, the process of collecting, assessing, and interpreting measurements requires significant human labor. Automating parts of this process via the use of mobile robots can help decrease labor burden, and increase the accuracy and frequency of data collections, and overall increase the adoption and use of ECa measurement technology. This paper introduces a roboticized means to autonomously perform geospatial ECa measurements and map soil moisture content in micro-irrigated orchard systems. We retrofit a small wheeled mobile robot with a small electromagnetic induction sensor by studying and taking into consideration the effect of the robot body to the sensor's readings, and develop a software stack to enable autonomous logging of geo-referenced measurements. The proposed roboticized ECa measurement method is evaluated by mapping a 50m x 30m field against the baseline of human-conducted measurements obtained by walking the sensor in the same field and following the same path. Experimental testing reveals that our approach yields roboticized measurements comparable to human-conducted ones, despite the robot's small form factor.\nIGrow: A Smart Agriculture Solution to Autonomous Greenhouse Control\t\"Xiaoyan Cao, \n      \n      Yao Yao, \n      \n      Lanqing Li, \n      \n      Wanpeng Zhang, \n      \n      Zhicheng An, \n      \n      Zhong Zhang, \n      \n      Li Xiao, \n      \n      Shihui Guo, \n      \n      Xiaoyu Cao, \n      \n      Meihong Wu, \n      \n      Dijun Luo\"\t2022/03/14\tAgriculture is the foundation of human civilization. However, the rapid increase of the global population poses a challenge on this cornerstone by demanding more food. Modern autonomous greenhouses, equipped with sensors and actuators, provide a promising solution to the problem by empowering precise control for high-efficient food production. However, the optimal control of autonomous greenhouses is challenging, requiring decision-making based on high-dimensional sensory data, and the scaling of production is limited by the scarcity of labor capable of handling this task. With the advances of artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing technologies, we are hopeful to provide a solution to automate and smarten greenhouse control to address the above challenges. In this paper, we propose a smart agriculture solution named iGrow, for autonomous greenhouse control (AGC): (1) for the first time, we formulate the AGC problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) optimization problem; (2) we design a neural network-based simulator incorporated with the incremental mechanism to simulate the complete planting process of an autonomous greenhouse, which provides a testbed for the optimization of control strategies; (3) we propose a closed-loop bi-level optimization algorithm, which can dynamically re-optimize the greenhouse control strategy with newly observed data during real-world production. We not only conduct simulation experiments but also deploy iGrow in real scenarios, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of iGrow in autonomous greenhouse simulation and optimal control. Particularly, compelling results from the tomato pilot project in real autonomous greenhouses show that our solution significantly increases crop yield (+10.15\\%) and net profit (+92.70\\%) with statistical significance compared to planting experts.\nMachine Learning Challenges and Opportunities in the African Agricultural Sector -- A General Perspective\tRacine Ly\t2021/07/11\tThe improvement of computers' capacities, advancements in algorithmic techniques, and the significant increase of available data have enabled the recent developments of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. One of its branches, called Machine Learning (ML), has shown strong capacities in mimicking characteristics attributed to human intelligence, such as vision, speech, and problem-solving. However, as previous technological revolutions suggest, their most significant impacts could be mostly expected on other sectors that were not traditional users of that technology. The agricultural sector is vital for African economies; improving yields, mitigating losses, and effective management of natural resources are crucial in a climate change era. Machine Learning is a technology with an added value in making predictions, hence the potential to reduce uncertainties and risk across sectors, in this case, the agricultural sector. The purpose of this paper is to contextualize and discuss barriers to ML-based solutions for African agriculture. In the second section, we provided an overview of ML technology from a historical and technical perspective and its main driving force. In the third section, we provided a brief review of the current use of ML in agriculture. Finally, in section 4, we discuss ML growing interest in Africa and the potential barriers to creating and using ML-based solutions in the agricultural sector.\nTowards a Multimodal System for Precision Agriculture using IoT and Machine Learning\t\"Satvik Garg, \n      \n      Pradyumn Pundir, \n      \n      Himanshu Jindal, \n      \n      Hemraj Saini, \n      \n      Somya",

The automation requires the assortment of information given by the sensors such as soil, water, light, humidity, temperature for additional information to furnish the operator with exact data to acquire excellent yield to farmers. In this work, a study is proposed that incorporates all common state-of-the-art approaches for precision agriculture use. Technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) for data collection, machine Learning for crop damage prediction, and deep learning for crop disease detection is used. The data collection using IoT is responsible for the measure of moisture levels for smart irrigation, n, p, k estimations of fertilizers for best yield development. For crop damage prediction, various algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), XGBoost (XGB), Decision Tree (DT) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are used. Subsequently, Pre-Trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such as VGG16, Resnet50, and DenseNet121 are also trained to check if the crop was tainted with some illness or not.\nSemantic Feature Matching for Robust Mapping in Agriculture\t\"Mohamad Qadri, \n      \n      George Kantor\"\t2021/07/08\tVisual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are an essential component in agricultural robotics that enable autonomous navigation and the construction of accurate 3D maps of agricultural fields. However, lack of texture, varying illumination conditions, and lack of structure in the environment pose a challenge for Visual-SLAM systems that rely on traditional feature extraction and matching algorithms such as ORB or SIFT. This paper proposes 1) an object-level feature association algorithm that enables the creation of 3D reconstructions robustly by taking advantage of the structure in robotic navigation in agricultural fields, and 2) An object-level SLAM system that utilizes recent advances in deep learning-based object detection and segmentation algorithms to detect and segment semantic objects in the environment used as landmarks for SLAM. We test our SLAM system on a stereo image dataset of a sorghum field. We show that our object-based feature association algorithm enables us to map 78% of a sorghum range on average. In contrast, with traditional visual features, we achieve an average mapped distance of 38%. We also compare our system against ORB-SLAM2, a state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm.\nNavigate-and-Seek: a Robotics Framework for People Localization in Agricultural Environments\t\"Riccardo Polvara, \n      \n      Francesco Del Duchetto, \n      \n      Gerhard Neumann, \n      \n      Marc Hanheide\"\t2021/07/08\tThe agricultural domain offers a working environment where many human laborers are nowadays employed to maintain or harvest crops, with huge potential for productivity gains through the introduction of robotic automation. Detecting and localizing humans reliably and accurately in such an environment, however, is a prerequisite to many services offered by fleets of mobile robots collaborating with human workers. Consequently, in this paper, we expand on the concept of a topological particle filter (TPF) to accurately and individually localize and track workers in a farm environment, integrating information from heterogeneous sensors and combining local active sensing (exploiting a robot's onboard sensing employing a Next-Best-Sense planning approach) and global localization (using affordable IoT GNSS devices). We validate the proposed approach in topologies created for the deployment of robotics fleets to support fruit pickers in a real farm environment. By combining multi-sensor observations on the topological level complemented by active perception through the NBS approach, we show that we can improve the accuracy of picker localization in comparison to prior work.\nLearned Visual Navigation for Under-Canopy Agricultural Robots\t\"Arun Narenthiran Sivakumar, \n      \n      Sahil Modi, \n      \n      Mateus Valverde Gasparino, \n      \n      Che Ellis, \n      \n      Andres Eduardo Baquero Velasquez, \n      \n      Girish Chowdhary, \n      \n      Saurabh Gupta\"\t2021/07/06\tWe describe a system for visually guided autonomous navigation of under-canopy farm robots. Low-cost under-canopy robots can drive between crop rows under the plant canopy and accomplish tasks that are infeasible for over-the-canopy drones or larger agricultural equipment. However, autonomously navigating them under the canopy presents a number of challenges: unreliable GPS and LiDAR, high cost of sensing, challenging farm terrain, clutter due to leaves and weeds, and large variability in appearance over the season and across crop types. We address these challenges by building a modular system that leverages machine learning for robust and generalizable perception from monocular RGB images from low-cost cameras, and model predictive control for accurate control in challenging terrain. Our system, CropFollow, is able to autonomously drive 485 meters per intervention on average, outperforming a state-of-the-art LiDAR based system (286 meters per intervention) in extensive field testing spanning over 25 km.\nTotal Nitrogen Estimation in Agricultural Soils via Aerial Multispectral Imaging and LIBS\t\"Md Abir Hossen, \n      \n      Prasoon K Diwaka, \n      \n      Shankar",

Most existing methods to measure soil health indicators (SHIs) are in-lab wet chemistry or spectroscopy-based methods, which require significant human input and effort, time-consuming, costly, and are low-throughput in nature. To address this challenge, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven near real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral sensing (UMS) solution to estimate total nitrogen (TN) of the soil, an important macro-nutrient or SHI that directly affects the crop health. Accurate prediction of soil TN can significantly increase crop yield through informed decision making on the timing of seed planting, and fertilizer quantity and timing. We train two machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron and support vector machine to predict the soil nitrogen using a suite of data classes including multispectral characteristics of the soil and crops in red, near-infrared, and green spectral bands, computed vegetation indices, and environmental variables including air temperature and relative humidity. To generate the ground-truth data or the training data for the machine learning models, we measure the total nitrogen of the soil samples (collected from a farm) using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).\nDeveloping system of wireless sensor network and unmaned aerial vehicle for agriculture inspection\t\"Nguyen Truong Son, \n      \n      Quach Cong Hoang, \n      \n      Dang Thi Huong Giang, \n      \n      Vu Minh Trung, \n      \n      Vuong Quang Huy, \n      \n      Mai Anh Tuan\"\t2021/06/20\tAgricultural production using high technology is an inevitable trend in Vietnam.

This paper constructs an experimental model of agricultural crop field monitoring using a combination of LoRa wireless sensor networks and unmanned aerial vehicles to collect data on conditions of weather and soil, plant health, which helps growers easily making right decisions on solutions for irrigation, pest treatment, and fertilization with the currently planted crops. The system has been developed and experimentized in the field to evaluate some basic features and justified the stability and reliability of the obtained data.\nMulti-Sensor Fusion based Robust Row Following for Compact Agricultural Robots\t\"Andres Eduardo Baquero Velasquez, \n      \n      Vitor Akihiro Hisano Higuti, \n      \n      Mateus Valverde Gasparino, \n      \n      Arun Narenthiran Sivakumar, \n      \n      Marcelo Becker, \n      \n      Girish Chowdhary\"\t2021/06/28\tThis paper presents a state-of-the-art LiDAR based autonomous navigation system for under-canopy agricultural robots. Under-canopy agricultural navigation has been a challenging problem because GNSS and other positioning sensors are prone to significant errors due to attentuation and multi-path caused by crop leaves and stems. Reactive navigation by detecting crop rows using LiDAR measurements is a better alternative to GPS but suffers from challenges due to occlusion from leaves under the canopy. Our system addresses this challenge by fusing IMU and LiDAR measurements using an Extended Kalman Filter framework on low-cost hardwware. In addition, a local goal generator is introduced to provide locally optimal reference trajectories to the onboard controller. Our system is validated extensively in real-world field environments over a distance of 50.88~km on multiple robots in different field conditions across different locations. We report state-of-the-art distance between intervention results, showing that our system is able to safely navigate without interventions for 386.9~m on average in fields without significant gaps in the crop rows, 56.1~m in production fields and 47.5~m in fields with gaps (space of 1~m without plants in both sides of the row).\nAutomated Agriculture Commodity Price Prediction System with Machine Learning Techniques\t\"Zhiyuan Chen, \n      \n      Howe Seng Goh, \n      \n      Kai Ling Sin, \n      \n      Kelly Lim, \n      \n      Nicole Ka Hei Chung, \n      \n      Xin Yu Liew\"\t2021/06/23\tThe intention of this research is to study and design an automated agriculture commodity price prediction system with novel machine learning techniques. Due to the increasing large amounts historical data of agricultural commodity prices and the need of performing accurate prediction of price fluctuations, the solution has largely shifted from statistical methods to machine learning area. However, the selection of proper set from historical data for forecasting still has limited consideration. On the other hand, when implementing machine learning techniques, finding a suitable model with optimal parameters for global solution, nonlinearity and avoiding curse of dimensionality are still biggest challenges, therefore machine learning strategies study are needed. In this research, we propose a web-based automated system to predict agriculture commodity price. In the two series experiments, five popular machine learning algorithms, ARIMA, SVR, Prophet, XGBoost and LSTM have been compared with large historical datasets in Malaysia and the most optimal algorithm, LSTM model with an average of 0.304 mean-square error has been selected as the prediction engine of the proposed system.\nVirtual Temporal Samples for Recurrent Neural",

We achieve this by proposing to generate virtual temporal samples from labelled still images. By exploiting the relatively static scene and assuming that the robot (camera) moves we are able to generate virtually labelled temporal sequences with no extra annotation effort. Normally, to train a recurrent neural network (RNN), labelled samples from a video (temporal) sequence are required which is laborious and has stymied work in this direction. By generating virtual temporal samples, we demonstrate that it is possible to train a lightweight RNN to perform semantic segmentation on two challenging agricultural datasets. Our results show that by training a temporal semantic segmenter using virtual samples we can increase the performance by an absolute amount of 4.64.6 and 4.94.9 on sweet pepper and sugar beet datasets, respectively. This indicates that our virtual data augmentation technique is able to accurately classify agricultural images temporally without the use of complicated synthetic data generation techniques nor with the overhead of labelling large amounts of temporal sequences.\nClimate, Agriculture and Food\tAriel Ortiz-Bobea\t2021/05/25\tAgriculture is arguably the most climate-sensitive sector of the economy.

Wallace, \n      \n      He Kong, \n      \n      Navid Pirmarzdashti, \n      \n      Salah Sukkarieh\"\t2021/05/22\tAchieving long-term autonomy for mobile robots operating in real-world unstructured environments such as farms remains a significant challenge. This is made increasingly complex in the presence of moving humans or livestock. These environments require a robot to be adaptive in its immediate plans, accounting for the state of nearby individuals and the response that they might have to the robot's actions. Additionally, in order to achieve longer-term goals, consideration of the limited on-board resources available to the robot is required, especially for extended missions such as weeding an agricultural field. To achieve efficient long-term autonomy, it is thus crucial to understand the impact that online dynamic updates to an energy efficient offline plan might have on resource usage whilst navigating through crowds or herds. To address these challenges, a hierarchical planning framework is proposed, integrating an online local dynamic path planner with an offline longer-term objective-based planner. This framework acts to achieve long-term autonomy through awareness of both dynamic responses of individuals to a robot's motion and the limited resources available. This paper details the hierarchical approach and its integration on a robotic platform, including a comprehensive description of the planning framework and associated perception modules. The approach is evaluated in real-world trials on farms, requiring both consideration of limited battery capacity and the presence of nearby moving individuals. These trials additionally demonstrate the ability of the framework to adapt resource use through variation of the local dynamic planner, allowing adaptive behaviour in changing environments.

While existing models for application quality focus on the quality experienced by the end-user (captured using likert scale), IoT applications have minimal human involvement and rely on machine to machine communication and analytics to drive decision via actuations. In this paper, we first present a conceptual framework for the evaluation of IoT application quality. Subsequently, we propose, develop and validate via empirical evaluations a novel model for evaluating sensor data quality that is a key component in assessing IoT application quality. We present an implementation of the sensor data quality model and demonstrate how the IoT sensor data quality can be integrated with a Smart Agriculture application. Results of experimental evaluations conducted using data from a real-world testbed concludes the paper.\nThe role of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in enhancing and stabilising farm income: an analysis of income transfer efficiency and the Income Stabilisation Tool\t\"Luigi Biagini, \n      \n      Simone Severini\"\t2021/04/29\tSince its inception, the E.U.'s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) aimed at ensuring an adequate and stable farm income. While recognizing that the CAP pursues a larger set of objectives, this thesis focuses on the impact of the CAP on the level and the stability of farm income in Italian farms. It uses microdata from a high standardized dataset, the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), that is available in all E.U. countries. This allows if perceived as useful, to replicate the analyses to other countries. The thesis first assesses the Income Transfer Efficiency (i.e., how much of the support translate to farm income) of several CAP measures. Secondly, it analyses the role of a specific and relatively new CAP measure (i.e., the Income Stabilisation Tool - IST) that is specifically aimed at stabilising farm income. The assessment of the potential use of Machine Learning procedures to develop an adequate ratemaking in IST. These are used to predict indemnity levels because this is an essential point for a similar insurance scheme. The assessment of ratemaking is challenging: indemnity distribution is zero-inflated, not-continuous, right-skewed, and several factors can potentially explain it. We address these problems by using Tweedie distributions and three Machine Learning procedures. The objective is to assess whether this improves the ratemaking by using the prospective application of the Income Stabilization Tool in Italy as a case study. We look at the econometric performance of the models and the impact of using their predictions in practice. Some of these procedures efficiently predict indemnities, using a limited number of regressors, and ensuring the scheme's financial stability.\nInvestigating farming efficiency through a two stage analytical approach: Application to the agricultural sector in Northern Oman\t\"Amar Oukil, \n      \n      Slim Zekri\"\t2021/04/22\tIn this paper, we develop a two-stage analytical framework to investigate farming efficiency.

In the second stage, we propose a stochastic model to identify potential sources of inefficiency. The latter model integrates within a unified structure all variables, including inputs, outputs and contextual factors. As an application ground, we use a sample of 60 farms from the Batinah coastal region, an agricultural area representing more than 53 per cent of the total cropped area of Oman. The findings of the study lay emphasis on the inter-dependence of groundwater salinity, irrigation technology and operational efficiency of a farm, with as a key recommendation the necessity for more regulated water consumption and a readjustment of governmental subsidiary policies.\nTerrain assessment for precision agriculture using vehicle dynamic modelling\t\"Giulio Reina, \n      \n      Annalisa Milella, \n      \n      Rocco Galati\"\t2021/04/13\tAdvances in precision agriculture greatly rely on innovative control and sensing technologies that allow service units to increase their level of driving automation while",

This paper deals with automatic terrain estimation and classification that is performed simultaneously by an agricultural vehicle during normal operations. Vehicle mobility and safety, and the successful implementation of important agricultural tasks including seeding, ploughing, fertilising and controlled traffic depend or can be improved by a correct identification of the terrain that is traversed. The novelty of this research lies in that terrain estimation is performed by using not only traditional appearance-based features, that is colour and geometric properties, but also contact-based features, that is measuring physics-based dynamic effects that govern the vehicleeterrain interaction and that greatly affect its mobility. Experimental results obtained from an all-terrain vehicle operating on different surfaces are presented to validate the system in the field. It was shown that a terrain classifier trained with contact features was able to achieve a correct prediction rate of 85.1%, which is comparable or better than that obtained with approaches using traditional feature sets. To further improve the classification performance, all feature sets were merged in an augmented feature space, reaching, for these tests, 89.1% of correct predictions.\nAmbient awareness for agricultural robotic vehicles\t\"Giulio Reina, \n      \n      Annalisa Milella, \n      \n      Raphael Rouveure, \n      \n      Michael Nielsen, \n      \n      Rainer Worst, \n      \n      Morten R. Blas\"\t2021/04/12\tIn the last few years, robotic technology has been increasingly employed in agriculture to develop intelligent vehicles that can improve productivity and competitiveness. Accurate and robust environmental perception is a critical requirement to address unsolved issues including safe interaction with field workers and animals, obstacle detection in controlled traffic applications, crop row guidance, surveying for variable rate applications, and situation awareness, in general, towards increased process automation. Given the variety of conditions thatmay be encountered in the field, no single sensor exists that can guarantee reliable results in every scenario. The development of a multi-sensory perception systemto increase the ambient awareness of an agricultural vehicle operating in crop fields is the objective of the Ambient Awareness for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicles (QUAD-AV) project. Different onboard sensor technologies, namely stereovision, LIDAR, radar, and thermography, are considered. Novel methods for their combination are proposed to automatically detect obstacles and discern traversable from non-traversable areas. Experimental results, obtained in agricultural contexts, are presented showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\nUnexpected novel Merbecovirus discoveries in agricultural sequencing datasets from Wuhan, China\t\"Daoyu Zhang, \n      \n      Adrian Jones, \n      \n      Yuri Deigin, \n      \n      Karl Sirotkin, \n      \n      Alejandro Sousa\"\t2021/06/06\tIn this study we document the unexpected discovery of multiple coronaviruses and a BSL-3 pathogen in agricultural cotton and rice sequencing datasets. In particular, we have identified a novel HKU5-related Merbecovirus in a cotton dataset sequenced by the Huazhong Agricultural University in 2017. We have also found an infectious clone sequence containing a novel HKU4-related Merbecovirus related to MERS coronavirus in a rice dataset sequenced by the Huazhong Agricultural University in early 2020. Another HKU5-related Merbecovirus, as well as Japanese encephalitis virus, were identified in a cotton dataset sequenced by the Huazhong Agricultural University in 2018. An HKU3-related Betacoronavirus was found in a Mus musculus sequencing dataset from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2017. Finally, a SARS-WIV1-like Betacoronavirus was found in a rice dataset sequenced by the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University in 2017. Using the contaminating reads we have extracted from the above datasets, we were able to assemble complete genomes of two novel coronaviruses which we disclose herein. In light of our findings, we raise concerns about biosafety protocol breaches, as indicated by our discovery of multiple dangerous human pathogens in agricultural sequencing laboratories in Wuhan and Fouzou City, China.\nBlockchain and smart contract for IoT enabled smart agriculture\t\"Tahmid Hasan Pranto, \n      \n      Abdulla All Noman, \n      \n      Atik Mahmud, \n      \n      AKM Bahalul Haque\"\t2021/04/01\tThe agricultural sector is still lagging behind from all other sectors in terms of using the newest technologies.

However, pre-harvest and post-harvest processing are still done by following traditional methodologies while tracing, storing, and publishing agricultural data. As a result, farmers are not getting deserved payment, consumers are not getting enough information before buying their product, and intermediate person/processors are increasing retail prices. Using blockchain, smart contracts, and IoT devices, we can fully automate the process while establishing absolute trust among all these parties. In this research, we explored the different aspects of using blockchain and smart contracts with the integration of IoT devices in pre-harvesting and post-harvesting segments of agriculture. We proposed a system that uses blockchain as the backbone while IoT devices collect data from the field level, and smart contracts regulate the interaction among all these contributing parties.

Renga, \n      \n      Matteo Matteucci\"\t2021/10/18\tThe application of digital technologies in agriculture can improve traditional practices to adapt to climate change, reduce Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions, and promote a sustainable intensification for food security. Some authors argued that we are experiencing a Digital Agricultural Revolution (DAR) that will boost sustainable farming. This study aims to find evidence of the ongoing DAR process and clarify its roots, what it means, and where it is heading. We investigated the scientific literature with bibliometric analysis tools to produce an objective and reproducible literature review. We retrieved 4995 articles by querying the Web of Science database in the timespan 2012-2019, and we analyzed the obtained dataset to answer three specific research questions: i) what is the spectrum of the DAR-related terminology?; ii) what are the key articles and the most influential journals, institutions, and countries?; iii) what are the main research streams and the emerging topics? By grouping the authors' keywords reported on publications, we identified five main research streams: Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), Site-Specific Management (SSM), Remote Sensing (RS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). To provide a broad overview of each of these topics, we analyzed relevant review articles, and we present here the main achievements and the ongoing challenges. Finally, we showed the trending topics of the last three years (2017, 2018, 2019).\nHigh precision control and deep learning-based corn stand counting algorithms for agricultural robot\t\"Zhongzhong Zhang, \n      \n      Erkan Kayacan, \n      \n      Benjamin Thompson, \n      \n      Girish Chowdhary\"\t2021/03/20\tThis paper presents high precision control and deep learning-based corn stand counting algorithms for a low-cost, ultra-compact 3D printed and autonomous field robot for agricultural operations. Currently, plant traits, such as emergence rate, biomass, vigor, and stand counting, are measured manually. This is highly labor-intensive and prone to errors. The robot, termed TerraSentia, is designed to automate the measurement of plant traits for efficient phenotyping as an alternative to manual measurements. In this paper, we formulate a Nonlinear Moving Horizon Estimator (NMHE) that identifies key terrain parameters using onboard robot sensors and a learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) that ensures high precision path tracking in the presence of unknown wheel-terrain interaction. Moreover, we develop a machine vision algorithm designed to enable an ultra-compact ground robot to count corn stands by driving through the fields autonomously. The algorithm leverages a deep network to detect corn plants in images, and a visual tracking model to re-identify detected objects at different time steps. We collected data from 53 corn plots in various fields for corn plants around 14 days after emergence (stage V3 - V4). The robot predictions have agreed well with the ground truth with Crobot=1.02×Chuman−0.86C_{robot}=1.02 \\times C_{human}-0.86 and a correlation coefficient R=0.96R=0.96. The mean relative error given by the algorithm is −3.78%-3.78\\%, and the standard deviation is 6.76%6.76\\%. These results indicate a first and significant step towards autonomous robot-based real-time phenotyping using low-cost, ultra-compact ground robots for corn and potentially other crops.\nRisk, Agricultural Production, and Weather Index Insurance in Village India\t\"Jeffrey D. Michler, \n      \n      Frederi G. Viens, \n      \n      Gerald E. Shively\"\t2021/03/19\tWe investigate the sources of variability in agricultural production and their relative importance in the context of weather index insurance for smallholder farmers in India. Using parcel-level panel data, multilevel modeling, and Bayesian methods we measure how large a role seasonal variation in weather plays in explaining yield variance. Seasonal variation in weather accounts for 19-20 percent of total variance in crop yields. Motivated by this result, we derive pricing and payout schedules for actuarially fair index insurance. These calculations shed light on the low uptake rates of index insurance and provide direction for designing more suitable index insurance.\nSwarm Robots in Agriculture\t\"Daniel Albiero, \n      \n      Angel Pontin Garcia, \n      \n      Claudio Kiyoshi Umezu, \n      \n      Rodrigo Leme de Paulo\"\t2021/03/11\tAgricultural mechanization is an area of knowledge that has evolved a lot over the past century, its main actors being agricultural tractors that, in 100 years, have increased their powers by 3,300%.

This paper aims to present an antiparadigmatic alternative in this area. It is proposing a swarm of small electric robotic tractors that together have the same field capacity as a large tractor with an internal combustion engine. A comparison of costs and field capacity between a 270 kW tractor and a swarm of ten swarm tractors of 24 kW each was carried out. The result demonstrated a wide advantage for the small robot team. It was also proposed the preliminary design of an electric swarm robot tractor. Finally, research challenges were suggested to operationalize such a proposal, calling on the Brazilian Robotics Research Community to elaborate a roadmap for research in the area of swarm robot for mechanized agricultural operations.\nDeep learning, machine vision in agriculture in 2021\tIldar Rakhmatulin\t2021/03/02\tOver the past decade, unprecedented progress in the development of neural networks influenced dozens of different industries, including weed recognition in the agro-industrial sector. The use of neural networks in agro-industrial activity in the task of recognizing cultivated crops is a new direction. The absence of any standards significantly complicates the understanding of the real situation of the use of the neural network in the agricultural sector. The manuscript presents the complete analysis of researches over the past 10 years on the use of neural networks for the classification and tracking of weeds due to neural networks. In particular, the analysis of the results of using various neural network algorithms for the task of classification and tracking was presented. As a result, we presented the recommendation for the use of neural networks in the tasks of recognizing a cultivated object and weeds. Using this standard can significantly improve the quality of research on this topic and simplify the analysis and understanding of any paper.\nImage Augmentation for Multitask Few-Shot Learning: Agricultural Domain Use-Case\t\"Sergey Nesteruk, \n      \n      Dmitrii Shadrin, \n      \n      Mariia Pukalchik\"\t2021/02/24\tLarge datasets' availability is catalyzing a rapid expansion of deep learning in general and computer vision in particular. At the same time, in many domains, a sufficient amount of training data is lacking, which may become an obstacle to the practical application of computer vision techniques. This paper challenges small and imbalanced datasets based on the example of a plant phenomics domain. We introduce an image augmentation framework, which enables us to extremely enlarge the number of training samples while providing the data for such tasks as object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, object counting, image denoising, and classification. We prove that our augmentation method increases model performance when only a few training samples are available. In our experiment, we use the DeepLabV3 model on semantic segmentation tasks with Arabidopsis and Nicotiana tabacum image dataset. The obtained result shows a 9% relative increase in model performance compared to the basic image augmentation techniques.\nBlockchain in agriculture\t\"Andreas Kamilaris, \n      \n      Ian Cole, \n      \n      Francesc X. Prenafeta-Boldu\"\t2021/02/12\tBlockchain is an emerging digital technology allowing ubiquitous financial transactions among distributed untrusted parties, without the need of intermediaries such as banks. This chapter examines the impact of blockchain technology in agriculture and food supply chain, presents existing ongoing projects and initiatives, and discusses overall implications, challenges and potential, with a critical view over the maturity of these projects. Our findings indicate that blockchain is a promising technology towards a transparent supply chain of food, with many ongoing initiatives in various food products and food-related issues, but many barriers and challenges still exist, which hinder its wider popularity among farmers and systems. These challenges involve technical aspects, education, policies and regulatory frameworks.\nMulti-source Pseudo-label Learning of Semantic Segmentation for the Scene Recognition of Agricultural Mobile Robots\t\"Shigemichi Matsuzaki, \n      \n      Jun Miura, \n      \n      Hiroaki Masuzawa\"\t2023/01/12\tThis paper describes a novel method of training a semantic segmentation model for scene recognition of agricultural mobile robots exploiting publicly available datasets of outdoor scenes that are different from the target greenhouse environments. Semantic segmentation models require abundant labels given by tedious manual annotation. A method to work around it is unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) that transfers knowledge from labeled source datasets to unlabeled target datasets. However, the effectiveness of existing methods is not well studied in adaptation between heterogeneous environments, such as urban scenes and greenhouses. In this paper, we propose a method to train a semantic segmentation model for greenhouse images without manually labeled datasets of greenhouse images. The core of our idea is to use multiple rich image datasets of different environments with segmentation labels to generate pseudo-labels for the target images to effectively transfer the knowledge from multiple sources and realize a precise training of semantic segmentation. Along with the pseudo-label generation, we introduce state-of-the-art methods to deal with noise in the pseudo-labels to further improve the performance. We demonstrate in experiments with multiple greenhouse datasets that our proposed method improves the performance compared to the single-source baselines and an existing approach.\nAnomaly Detection through Transfer Learning in Agriculture and Manufacturing IoT Systems\t\"Mustafa Abdallah, \n      \n      Wo Jae Lee, \n      \n      Nithin Raghunathan, \n      \n      Charilaos Mousoulis, \n      \n      John W.

Sutherland, \n      \n      Saurabh Bagchi\"\t2021/02/10\t\"IoT systems have been facing increasingly sophisticated technical problems due to the growing complexity of these systems and their fast deployment practices. Consequently, IoT managers have to judiciously detect failures (anomalies) in order to reduce their cyber risk and operational cost. While there is a rich literature on anomaly detection in many IoT-based systems, there is no existing work that documents the use of ML models for anomaly detection in digital agriculture and in smart manufacturing systems. These two application domains pose certain salient technical challenges. In agriculture the data is often sparse, due to the vast areas of farms and the requirement to keep the cost of monitoring low. Second, in both domains, there are multiple types of sensors with varying capabilities and costs. The sensor data characteristics change with the operating point of the environment or machines, such as, the RPM of the motor. The inferencing and the anomaly detection processes therefore have to be calibrated for the operating point.\n  In this paper, we analyze data from sensors deployed in an agricultural farm with data from seven different kinds of sensors, and from an advanced manufacturing testbed with vibration sensors. We evaluate the performance of ARIMA and LSTM models for predicting the time series of sensor data. Then, considering the sparse data from one kind of sensor, we perform transfer learning from a high data rate sensor. We then perform anomaly detection using the predicted sensor data. Taken together, we show how in these two application domains, predictive failure classification can be achieved, thus paving the way for predictive maintenance.\"\nTransforming India's Agricultural Sector using Ontology-based Tantra Framework\tShreekanth M Prabhu\t2021/01/25\tFood production is a critical activity in which every nation would like to be self-sufficient. India is one of the largest producers of food grains in the world. In India, nearly 70 percent of rural households still depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Keeping farmers happy is particularly important in India as farmers form a large vote bank which politicians dare not disappoint. At the same time, Governments need to balance the interest of farmers with consumers, intermediaries and society at large. The whole agriculture sector is highly information-intensive. Even with enormous collection of data and statistics from different arms of Government, there continue to be information gaps. In this paper we look at how Tantra Social Information Management Framework can help analyze the agricultural sector and transform the same using a holistic approach. Advantage of Tantra Framework approach is that it looks at societal information as a whole without limiting it to only the sector at hand. Tantra Framework makes use of concepts from Zachman Framework to manage aspects of social information through different perspectives and concepts from Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) to represent interrelationships between aspects. Further, Tantra Framework interoperates with models such as Balanced Scorecard, Theory of Change and Theory of Separations. Finally, we model Indian Agricultural Sector as a business ecosystem and look at approaches to steer transformation from within.\nTask Planning on Stochastic Aisle Graphs for Precision Agriculture\t\"Xinyue Kan, \n      \n      Thomas C. Thayer, \n      \n      Stefano Carpin, \n      \n      Konstantinos Karydis\"\t2021/02/02\tThis work addresses task planning under uncertainty for precision agriculture applications whereby task costs are uncertain and the gain of completing a task is proportional to resource consumption (such as water consumption in precision irrigation). The goal is to complete all tasks while prioritizing those that are more urgent, and subject to diverse budget thresholds and stochastic costs for tasks. To describe agriculture-related environments that incorporate stochastic costs to complete tasks, a new Stochastic-Vertex-Cost Aisle Graph (SAG) is introduced. Then, a task allocation algorithm, termed Next-Best-Action Planning (NBA-P), is proposed. NBA-P utilizes the underlying structure enabled by SAG, and tackles the task planning problem by simultaneously determining the optimal tasks to perform and an optimal time to exit (i.e. return to a base station), at run-time. The proposed approach is tested with both simulated data and real-world experimental datasets collected in a commercial vineyard, in both single- and multi-robot scenarios. In all cases, NBA-P outperforms other evaluated methods in terms of return per visited vertex, wasted resources resulting from aborted tasks (i.e. when a budget threshold is exceeded), and total visited vertices.\nSuperhydrophobic sand mulches increase agricultural productivity in arid regions\t\"Adair Gallo Jr., \n      \n      Kennedy Odokonyero, \n      \n      Magdi A.

While plastic mulches can reduce evaporation from the topsoil, their cost and non-biodegradability limit their utility. In response, we report on superhydrophobic sand (SHS), a bio-inspired enhancement of common sand with a nanoscale wax coating. When SHS was applied as a 5 mm-thick mulch over the soil, evaporation dramatically reduced and crop yields increased. Multi-year field trials of SHS application with tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and wheat (Triticum aestivum) under normal irrigation enhanced yields by 17%-73%. Under brackish water irrigation (5500 ppm NaCl), SHS mulching produced 53%-208% higher fruit yield and grain gains for tomato and barley. Thus, SHS could benefit agriculture and city-greening in arid regions.\nA Robust Illumination-Invariant Camera System for Agricultural Applications\t\"Abhisesh Silwal, \n      \n      Tanvir Parhar, \n      \n      Francisco Yandun, \n      \n      George Kantor\"\t2021/01/06\tObject detection and semantic segmentation are two of the most widely adopted deep learning algorithms in agricultural applications. One of the major sources of variability in image quality acquired in the outdoors for such tasks is changing lighting condition that can alter the appearance of the objects or the contents of the entire image. While transfer learning and data augmentation to some extent reduce the need for large amount of data to train deep neural networks, the large variety of cultivars and the lack of shared datasets in agriculture makes wide-scale field deployments difficult. In this paper, we present a high throughput robust active lighting-based camera system that generates consistent images in all lighting conditions. We detail experiments that show the consistency in images quality leading to relatively fewer images to train deep neural networks for the task of object detection. We further present results from field experiment under extreme lighting conditions where images without active lighting significantly lack to provide consistent results. The experimental results show that on average, deep nets for object detection trained on consistent data required nearly four times less data to achieve similar level of accuracy. This proposed work could potentially provide pragmatic solutions to computer vision needs in agriculture.\nPredicting Illness for a Sustainable Dairy Agriculture: Predicting and Explaining the Onset of Mastitis in Dairy Cows\t\"Cathal Ryan, \n      \n      Christophe Guéret, \n      \n      Donagh Berry, \n      \n      Medb Corcoran, \n      \n      Mark T.

The use of AI techniques to identify the early onset of this disease, thus has significant implications for the sustainability of this agricultural sector. Current approaches to treating mastitis involve antibiotics and this practice is coming under ever increasing scrutiny. Using machine learning models to identify cows at risk of developing mastitis and applying targeted treatment regimes to only those animals promotes a more sustainable approach. Incorrect predictions from such models, however, can lead to monetary losses, unnecessary use of antibiotics, and even the premature death of animals, so it is important to generate compelling explanations for predictions to build trust with users and to better support their decision making. In this paper we demonstrate a system developed to predict mastitis infections in cows and provide explanations of these predictions using counterfactuals. We demonstrate the system and describe the engagement with farmers undertaken to build it.\nA Pilot Study of Smart Agricultural Irrigation using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and IoT-Based Cloud System\t\"Mohamed Esmail Karar, \n      \n      Faris Alotaibi, \n      \n      Abdullah AL Rasheed, \n      \n      Omar Reyad\"\t2021/01/05\tThis article introduces a new mobile-based application of modern information and communication technology in agriculture based on Internet of Things (IoT), embedded systems and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed agricultural monitoring system was designed and implemented using Arduino microcontroller boards, Wi-Fi modules, water pumps and electronic environmental sensors, namely temperature, humidity and soil moisture. The role of UAV in this study is to collect these environmental data from different regions of the farm. Then, the quantity of water irrigation is automatically computed for each region in the cloud. Moreover, the developed system can monitor the farm conditions including the water requirements remotely on Android mobile application to guide the farmers. The results of this study demonstrated that our proposed IoT-based embedded system can be effective to avoid unnecessary and wasted water irrigation within the framework of smart agriculture.\nDesigns with complex blocking structures and network effects for agricultural field experiments\t\"Vasiliki Koutra, \n      \n      Steven G.

We consider a field trial run at Rothamsted Research and provide a comparison of optimal designs under various different models, including the commonly used designs in such situations. It is shown that when there is interference between treatments on neighbouring plots, due to the spatial arrangement of the plots, designs incorporating network effects are at least as, and often more efficient than, randomised row-column designs. The advantage of network designs is that we can construct the neighbour structure even for an irregular layout by means of a graph to address the particular characteristics of the experiment. The",

It is shown that when there is interference between treatments on neighbouring plots, due to the spatial arrangement of the plots, designs incorporating network effects are at least as, and often more efficient than, randomised row-column designs. The advantage of network designs is that we can construct the neighbour structure even for an irregular layout by means of a graph to address the particular characteristics of the experiment. The need for such designs arises when it is required to account for treatment-induced patterns of heterogeneity. Ignoring the network structure can lead to imprecise estimates of the treatment parameters and invalid conclusions.\nEstimating the Impact of Weather on Agriculture\t\"Jeffrey D. Michler, \n      \n      Anna Josephson, \n      \n      Talip Kilic, \n      \n      Siobhan Murray\"\t2021/10/04\tThis paper quantifies the significance and magnitude of the effect of measurement error in remote sensing weather data in the analysis of smallholder agricultural productivity. The analysis leverages 17 rounds of nationally-representative, panel household survey data from six countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. These data are spatially-linked with a range of geospatial weather data sources and related metrics. We provide systematic evidence on measurement error introduced by 1) different methods used to obfuscate the exact GPS coordinates of households, 2) different metrics used to quantify precipitation and temperature, and 3) different remote sensing measurement technologies. First, we find no discernible effect of measurement error introduced by different obfuscation methods. Second, we find that simple weather metrics, such as total seasonal rainfall and mean daily temperature, outperform more complex metrics, such as deviations in rainfall from the long-run average or growing degree days, in a broad range of settings. Finally, we find substantial amounts of measurement error based on remote sensing product. In extreme cases, data drawn from different remote sensing products result in opposite signs for coefficients on weather metrics, meaning that precipitation or temperature draw from one product purportedly increases crop output while the same metrics drawn from a different product purportedly reduces crop output. We conclude with a set of six best practices for researchers looking to combine remote sensing weather data with socioeconomic survey data.\n39 Hints to Facilitate the Use of Semantics for Data on Agriculture and Nutrition\t\"Caterina Caracciolo, \n      \n      Sophie Aubin, \n      \n      Clement Jonquet, \n      \n      Emna Amdouni, \n      \n      Romain David, \n      \n      Leyla Garcia, \n      \n      Brandon Whitehead, \n      \n      Catherine Roussey, \n      \n      Armando Stellato, \n      \n      Ferdinando Villa\"\t2020/12/15\tIn this paper, we report on the outputs and adoption of the Agrisemantics Working Group of the Research Data Alliance (RDA), consisting of a set of recommendations to facilitate the adoption of semantic technologies and methods for the purpose of data interoperability in the field of agriculture and nutrition. From 2016 to 2019, the group gathered researchers and practitioners at the crossing point between information technology and agricultural science, to study all aspects in the life cycle of semantic resources: conceptualization, edition, sharing, standardization, services, alignment, long term support. First, the working group realized a landscape study, a study of the uses of semantics in agrifood, then collected use cases for the exploitation of semantics resources-a generic term to encompass vocabularies, terminologies, thesauri, ontologies. The resulting requirements were synthesized into 39 \"hints\" for users and developers of semantic resources, and providers of semantic resource services. We believe adopting these recommendations will engage agrifood sciences in a necessary transition to leverage data production, sharing and reuse and the adoption of the FAIR data principles. The paper includes examples of adoption of those requirements, and a discussion of their contribution to the field of data science.\nA web-tool for calculating the economic performance of precision agriculture technology\t\"Marco Medici, \n      \n      Søren Marcus Pedersen, \n      \n      Maurizio Canavari, \n      \n      Thomas Anken, \n      \n      Panagiotis Stamatelopoulos, \n      \n      Zisis Tsiropoulos, \n      \n      Alex Zotos, \n      \n      Ghasem Tohidloo\"\t2020/12/09\tTo develop precision agriculture (PA) to its full potential and make agriculture progress toward sustainability and resilience, appropriate criteria for the economic assessment are recognised as being one of the most significant issues requiring urgent and ongoing attention. In this work, we develop a web-tool supporting the assessment of the net economic benefits of integrating precision farming technologies in different contexts. The methodological approach of the tool is accessible to any agricultural stakeholder through a guided process that allows to evaluate and compare precision agriculture technologies with conventional systems, leading the final user to assess the financial viability and environmental impact resulting from the potential implementation of various precision agriculture technologies in his farm. The web-tool is designed to provide guidelines for farmers over their decisions to invest in selected PA technologies, by increasing the knowledge level about novel technologies characteristics and the related benefits. Possible input reduction also offers the possibility to investigate the mitigation of environmental impacts.\nDynamic Structure Learning through Graph Neural Network for Forecasting Soil Moisture in Precision Agriculture\t\"Anoushka Vyas, \n      \n      Sambaran Bandyopadhyay\"\t2022/05/16\tSoil moisture is an important component of precision agriculture as it directly impacts the growth and quality of vegetation.

In recent literature, conventional machine learning models have been applied for this problem.

In this work, we propose a novel graph neural network based solution that learns temporal graph structures and forecast soil moisture in an end-to-end framework.

The index integrates surface soil moisture from the SMOS mission with land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from MODIS and allows for global drought monitoring at medium spatial scales (0.05 deg).. Biweekly maps of SMADI were obtained from year 2010 to 2015 over all agricultural areas on Earth. The SMADI time-series were compared with state-of-the-art drought indices over the Iberian Peninsula. Results show a good agreement between SMADI and the Crop Moisture Index (CMI) retrieved at five weather stations (with correlation coefficient, R from -0.64 to -0.79) and the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) at the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS) (R=-0.83). Some preliminary tests were also made over the continental United States using the Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI), with very encouraging results regarding the spatial occurrence of droughts during summer seasons. Additionally, SMADI allowed to identify distinctive patterns of regional drought over the Indian Peninsula in spring of 2012. Overall results support the use of SMADI for monitoring agricultural drought events world-wide.\nMeasuring Bangladeshi Female Farmers' Values for Agriculture Mobile Applications Development\t\"Rifat Ara Shams, \n      \n      Mojtaba Shahin, \n      \n      Gillian Oliver, \n      \n      Waqar Hussain, \n      \n      Harsha Perera, \n      \n      Arif Nurwidyantoro, \n      \n      Jon Whittle\"\t2020/11/22\tThe ubiquity of mobile applications (apps) in daily life raises the imperative that the apps should reflect users' values. However, users' values are not usually taken into account in app development. Thus there is significant potential for user dissatisfaction and negative socio-economic consequences. To be cognizant of values in apps, the first step is to find out what those values are, and that was the objective of this study conducted in Bangladesh. Our focus was on rural women, specifically female farmers. The basis for our study was Schwartz's universal human values theory, and we used an associated survey instrument, the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ). Our survey of 193 Bangladeshi female farmers showed that Conformity and Security were regarded as the most important values, while Power, Hedonism, and Stimulation were the least important. This finding would be helpful for developers to take into account when developing agriculture apps for this market. In addition, the methodology we used provides a model to follow to elicit the values of apps' users in other communities.\nOn the benefits of index insurance in US agriculture: a large-scale analysis using satellite data\t\"Matthieu Stigler, \n      \n      David Lobell\"\t2021/11/07\t\"Index insurance has been promoted as a promising solution for reducing agricultural risk compared to traditional farm-based insurance. By linking payouts to a regional factor instead of individual loss, index insurance reduces monitoring costs, and alleviates the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection. Despite its theoretical appeal, demand for index insurance has remained low in many developing countries, triggering a debate on the causes of the low uptake. Surprisingly, there has been little discussion in this debate about the experience in the United States. The US is an unique case as both farm-based and index-based products have been available for more than two decades. Furthermore, the number of insurance zones is very large, allowing interesting comparisons over space. As in developing countries, the adoption of index insurance is rather low -- less than than 5\\% of insured acreage. Does this mean that we should give up on index insurance?\n  In this paper, we investigate the low take-up of index insurance in the US leveraging a field-level dataset for corn and soybean obtained from satellite predictions. While previous studies were based either on county aggregates or on relatively small farm-level dataset, our satellite-derived data gives us a very large number of fields (close to 1.8 million) comprised within a large number of index zones (600) observed over 20 years. To evaluate the suitability of index insurance, we run a large-scale simulation comparing the benefits of both insurance schemes using a new measure of farm-equivalent risk coverage of index insurance. We make two main contributions. First, we show that in our simulations, demand for index insurance is unexpectedly high, at about 30\\% to 40\\% of total demand.",

The continuous and increasing use of pesticides in agricultural and urban activities results in the pollution of water resources and represents an environmental risk. To control and reduce pesticide pollution, reliable multi-residue methods for the detection of these compounds in water are needed. In this context, the present work aimed at providing an analytical method for the simultaneous determination of trace levels of 51 target pesticides in water and applying it to the investigation of target pesticides in two agriculture-impacted areas of interest. The method developed, based on an isotopic dilution approach and on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, is fast, simple, and to a large extent automated, and allows the analysis of most of the target compounds in compliance with European regulations. Further application of the method to the analysis of selected water samples collected at the lowest stretches of the two largest river basins of Catalonia (NE Spain), Llobregat and Ter, revealed the presence of a wide suite of pesticides, and some of them at concentrations above the water quality standards (irgarol and dichlorvos) or the acceptable method detection limits (methiocarb, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid), in the Llobregat, and much cleaner waters in the Ter River basin. Risk assessment of the pesticide concentrations measured in the Llobregat indicated high risk due to the presence of irgarol, dichlorvos, methiocarb, azinphos ethyl, imidacloprid, and diflufenican (hazard quotient (HQ) values>10), and an only moderate potential risk in the Ter River associated to the occurrence of bentazone and irgarol (HQ>1).\nMicroalgae-based bioremediation of water contaminated by pesticides in peri-urban agricultural areas\t\"M.

The study was carried out in July to study its efficiency under the best conditions (highest solar irradiation). A total of 51 pesticides, including 10 transformation products, were selected and investigated based on their consumption rate and environmental relevance. Sixteen of them were detected in the agricultural run-off, and the estimated removal efficiencies ranged from negative values, obtained for 3 compounds, namely terbutryn, diuron, and imidacloprid, to 100%, achieved for 10 compounds. The acidic herbicide MCPA was removed by 88% on average, and the insecticides 2,4-D and diazinon showed variable removals, between 100% and negative values. The environmental risk associated with the compounds still present in the effluent of the PBR was evaluated using hazard quotients (HQs), calculated using the average and highest measured concentrations of the compounds. HQ values > 10 (meaning high risk) were obtained for imidacloprid (21), between 1 and 10 (meaning moderate risk) for 2,4-D (2.8), diazinon (4.6) and terbutryn (1.5), and < 1 (meaning low risk) for the remaining compounds diuron, linuron, and MCPA. The PBR treatment yielded variable removals depending on the compound, similar to conventional wastewater treatment plants. This study provides new data on the capacity of icroalgae-based treatment systems to eliminate a wide range of priority pesticides under real/environmental conditions.\nOAK: Ontology-Based Knowledge Map Model for Digital Agriculture\t\"Quoc Hung Ngo, \n      \n      Tahar Kechadi, \n      \n      Nhien-An Le-Khac\"\t2020/11/20\tNowadays, a huge amount of knowledge has been amassed in digital agriculture. This knowledge and know-how information are collected from various sources, hence the question is how to organise this knowledge so that it can be efficiently exploited. Although this knowledge about agriculture practices can be represented using ontology, rule-based expert systems, or knowledge model built from data mining processes, the scalability still remains an open issue. In this study, we propose a knowledge representation model, called an ontology-based knowledge map, which can collect knowledge from different sources, store it, and exploit either directly by stakeholders or as an input to the knowledge discovery process (Data Mining). The proposed model consists of two stages, 1) build an ontology as a knowledge base for a specific domain and data mining concepts, and 2) build the ontology-based knowledge map model for representing and storing the knowledge mined on the crop datasets.",

Unrestricted use of herbicide for weed removal alters biodiversity and cause environmental pollution. Instead, identifying weed-infested regions can aid selective chemical treatment of these regions. Advances in analyzing farm images have resulted in solutions to identify weed plants. However, a majority of these approaches are based on supervised learning methods which requires huge amount of manually annotated images. As a result, these supervised approaches are economically infeasible for the individual farmer because of the wide variety of plant species being cultivated. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based semi-supervised approach for robust estimation of weed density and distribution across farmlands using only limited color images acquired from autonomous robots. This weed density and distribution can be useful in a site-specific weed management system for selective treatment of infected areas using autonomous robots. In this work, the foreground vegetation pixels containing crops and weeds are first identified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based unsupervised segmentation. Subsequently, the weed infected regions are identified using a fine-tuned CNN, eliminating the need for designing hand-crafted features. The approach is validated on two datasets of different crop/weed species (1) Crop Weed Field Image Dataset (CWFID), which consists of carrot plant images and the (2) Sugar Beets dataset. The proposed method is able to localize weed-infested regions a maximum recall of 0.99 and estimate weed density with a maximum accuracy of 82.13%. Hence, the proposed approach is shown to generalize to different plant species without the need for extensive labeled data.\nSLAM in the Field: An Evaluation of Monocular Mapping and Localization on Challenging Dynamic Agricultural Environment\t\"Fangwen Shu, \n      \n      Paul Lesur, \n      \n      Yaxu Xie, \n      \n      Alain Pagani, \n      \n      Didier Stricker\"\t2020/11/06\tThis paper demonstrates a system capable of combining a sparse, indirect, monocular visual SLAM, with both offline and real-time Multi-View Stereo (MVS) reconstruction algorithms. This combination overcomes many obstacles encountered by autonomous vehicles or robots employed in agricultural environments, such as overly repetitive patterns, need for very detailed reconstructions, and abrupt movements caused by uneven roads. Furthermore, the use of a monocular SLAM makes our system much easier to integrate with an existing device, as we do not rely on a LiDAR (which is expensive and power consuming), or stereo camera (whose calibration is sensitive to external perturbation e.g. camera being displaced). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first evaluation results for monocular SLAM, and our work further explores unsupervised depth estimation on this specific application scenario by simulating RGB-D SLAM to tackle the scale ambiguity, and shows our approach produces reconstructions that are helpful to various agricultural tasks. Moreover, we highlight that our experiments provide meaningful insight to improve monocular SLAM systems under agricultural settings.\niPaaS in Agriculture 4.0: An Industrial Case\t\"Rafael Cestari, \n      \n      Sebastien Ducos, \n      \n      Ernesto Exposito\"\t2020/10/08\tCurrent automation approaches in the Industry 4.0 have generated increased interest in the utilization of Integration Platforms as a Service (iPaaS) cloud architectures in order to unify and synchronize several systems, applications, and services in order to build smart solutions for automated and adaptive industrial process management. Existing iPaaS solutions present several out-of-the-box connectors and automation engines for easier integration of customers' projects, but show issues regarding overall adaptation outside their scope, brand locking, and occasionally high prices. Moreover, existing platforms fail to respond adequately to the needs of deploying multiple decision models capable of offering automated or semi-automated management of processes, thanks to the integration of the large diversity of data and event sources as well as the different physical or logical action entities. With the popularization of open-source software and applications such as BPM Engines, Machine Learning libraries, and Integration suites and libraries, it is possible to develop a fully customizable and adaptable, open-source iPaaS that can be used both in and outside industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a generic iPaaS architecture implemented on the basis of several open source solutions boasting integration, interoperability, and automated decision-making capabilities in the domain of Agriculture 4.0. A proof-of-concept based on these solutions is presented, as well as a case study on MA{Ï}SADOUR's grain storage process with a comparison with the currently human-operated tasks.\nAutomatic Extraction of Agriculture Terms from Domain Text: A Survey of Tools and Techniques\t\"Niladri Chatterjee, \n      \n      Neha Kaushik\"\t2020/09/24\tAgriculture is a key component in any country's development.

Domain-specific knowledge resources serve to gain insight into the domain. Existing knowledge resources such as AGROVOC and NAL Thesaurus are developed and maintained by the domain experts. Population of terms into these knowledge resources can be automated by using automatic term extraction tools for processing unstructured agricultural text. Automatic term extraction is also a key component in many semantic web applications, such as ontology creation, recommendation systems, sentiment classification, query expansion among others. The primary goal of an automatic term extraction system is to maximize the number of valid terms and minimize the number of invalid terms extracted from the input set of documents. Despite its importance in various applications, the availability of online tools for the said purpose is rather limited. Moreover, the performance of the most popular ones among them varies significantly. As a consequence, selection of the right term extraction tool is perceived as a serious problem for different knowledge-based applications. This paper presents an analysis of three commonly used term extraction tools, viz. RAKE, TerMine, TermRaider and compares their performance in terms of precision and recall, vis-a-vis RENT, a more recent term extractor developed by these authors for agriculture domain.\nMulticlass Model for Agriculture development using Multivariate Statistical method\t\"N Deepa, \n      \n      Mohammad Zubair Khan, \n      \n      Prabadevi B, \n      \n      Durai Raj Vincent P M, \n      \n      Praveen Kumar Reddy Maddikunta, \n      \n      Thippa Reddy Gadekallu\"\t2020/10/07\tMahalanobis taguchi system (MTS) is a multi-variate statistical method extensively used for feature selection and binary classification problems. The calculation of orthogonal array and signal-to-noise ratio in MTS makes the algorithm complicated when more number of factors are involved in the classification problem. Also the decision is based on the accuracy of normal and abnormal observations of the dataset. In this paper, a multiclass model using Improved Mahalanobis Taguchi System (IMTS) is proposed based on normal observations and Mahalanobis distance for agriculture development. Twenty-six input factors relevant to crop cultivation have been identified and clustered into six main factors for the development of the model. The multiclass model is developed with the consideration of the relative importance of the factors. An objective function is defined for the classification of three crops, namely paddy, sugarcane and groundnut. The classification results are verified against the results obtained from the agriculture experts working in the field. The proposed classifier provides 100% accuracy, recall, precision and 0% error rate when compared with other traditional classifier models.\nExploring Scientific Exchange in Agricultural Meteorology with Network Analysis\t\"Giuditta Parolini, \n      \n      Silvio R. Dahmen\"\t2020/08/31\tNetwork analysis is becoming increasingly relevant in the historical investigation of scientific communities and their knowledge circulation process, because it offers the opportunity to explore and visualize connections amog scientific actors on a scale qualitatively different from traditional historical methods. Temporal networks are especially suitable for this task, as they allow to investigate the evolution of scientific communities over time. In this paper we will rely on the analytical tools provided by temporal networks to examine the technical comission on agriculture (1913 - 1947) established by the International Meteorological Organization (IMO). By using the membership data available on this commission, we will investigate how this scientific community evolved over the decades, who were its key members, which national groups were represented, and how historical events, such as the two world wars, impacted on the work of this organization. This will give us an insight into the knowledge circulation process of this scientific body, as the IMO was an international organization based on voluntary cooperation and its work was first and foremost the immediate consequence of the interaction amog its members. In our paper we will rely on centrality measures (eigenvector, joint, and conditional centrality) to understand the structure of the comission's network, and we will constantly point out the strengths and weaknesses of temporal networks in the analysis of historical data.\nReviewing climate change and agricultural market competitiveness\t\"Bakhtmina Zia, \n      \n      Dr Muhammad Rafiq PhD Research Scholar, \n      \n      Institute of Management Sciences, \n      \n       Peshawar, \n      \n       Pakistan, \n      \n      Associate Professor, \n      \n      Institute of Management Sciences, \n      \n       Peshawar, \n      \n       Pakistan\"\t2020/08/31\tThe paper is a collection of knowledge regarding the phenomenon of climate change, competitiveness, and literature linking the two phenomena to agricultural market competitiveness.

The paper concludes by identifying implications for developing an agricultural competitiveness index while incorporating the climate change impacts, to enhance the potential of agricultural markets for optimizing the agricultural sectors competitiveness.\nReproducible Pruning System on Dynamic Natural Plants for Field Agricultural Robots\t\"Sunny Katyara, \n      \n      Fanny Ficuciello, \n      \n      Darwin G.

The 3D models of vines are constructed in blender engine and rendered in simulated environment as a need for training the robot. The Natural Admittance Controller (NAC) is applied to deal with the dynamics of vines. It uses force feedback and compensates the friction effects while maintaining the passivity of system. The faster R-CNN is used to detect the spurs on the vines and then statistical pattern recognition algorithm using K-means clustering is applied to find the effective pruning points. The proposed framework is tested in simulated and real environments.\nSeed-packed dielectric barrier device for plasma agriculture: understanding its electrical properties through an equivalent electrical model\t\"Florian Judée, \n      \n      Thierry Dufour\"\t2020/07/27\tSeeds have been packed in a dielectric barrier device where cold atmospheric plasma has been generated to improve their germinative properties. A special attention has been paid on understanding the resulting plasma electrical properties through an equivalent electrical model whose experimental validity has been demonstrated here. In this model, the interelectrode gap is subdivided into 4 types of elementary domains, according to whether they contain electric charges (or not) and according to their type of medium (gas, seed or insulator). The model enables to study the influence of seeds on the plasma electrical properties by measuring and deducing several parameters (charge per filament, gas capacitance, plasma power, ...) either in no-bed configuration (i.e. no seed in the reactor) or in packed-bed configuration (seeds in the reactor). In that second case, we have investigated how seeds can influence the plasma electrical parameters considering six specimens of seeds (beans, radishes, corianders, lentils, sunflowers and corns). The influence of molecular oxygen (0-100 sccm) mixed with a continuous flow rate of helium (2 slm) is also investigated, especially through filaments breakdown voltages, charge per filament and plasma power. It is demonstrated that such bed-packing drives to an increase in the gas capacitance, to a decrease in the beta-parameter and to variations of the filaments' breakdown voltages in a seed-dependent manner. Finally, we show how the equivalent electrical model can be used to assess the total volume of the contact points, the capacitance of the seeds in the packed-bed configuration and we demonstrate that germinative effects can be induced by plasma on four of the six agronomical specimens.\nAnalysis of Agricultural Policy Recommendations using Multi-Agent Systems\t\"Satyandra Guthula, \n      \n      Sunil Simon, \n      \n      Harish Karnick\"\t2020/08/11\tDespite agriculture being the primary source of livelihood for more than half of India's population, several socio-economic policies are implemented in the Indian agricultural sector without paying enough attention to the possible outcomes of the policies. The negative impact of some policies can be seen in the huge distress suffered by farmers as documented by several studies and reported in the media on a regular basis. In this paper, we model a specific troubled agricultural sub-system in India as a Multi-Agent System and use it to analyse the impact of some policies. Ideally, we should be able to model the entire system, including all the external dependencies from other systems - for example availability of labour or water may depend on other sources of employment, water rights and so on - but for our purpose, we start with a fairly basic model not taking into account such external effects. As per our knowledge there are no available models which considers factors like water levels, availability of information and market simulation in the Indian context. So, we plugged in various entities into the model to make it sufficiently close to observed realities, at least in some selected regions of India. We evaluate some policy options to get an understanding of changes that may happen once such policies are implemented. Then we recommended some policies based on the result of the simulation.\nBracing for sustainable agriculture: the development and function of brace roots in members of Poaceae\t\"Ashley N. Hostetler, \n      \n      Rajdeep S. Khangura, \n      \n      Brian P. Dilkes, \n      \n      Erin E. Sparks\"\t2020/12/01\tOptimization of crop production requires root systems to function in water uptake, nutrient use, and anchorage. In maize, two types of nodal roots-subterranean crown and aerial brace roots function in anchorage and water uptake and preferentially express multiple water and nutrient transporters. Brace root development shares genetic control with juvenile-to-adult phase change and flowering time. We present a comprehensive list of the genes known to alter brace roots and explore these as candidates for QTL studies in maize and sorghum. Brace root development and function may be conserved in other members of Poaceae, however research is limited. This work highlights the critical knowledge gap of aerial nodal root development and function and suggests new focus areas for breeding resilient crops.\nThe Importance and the Limitations of Sim2Real for Robotic Manipulation in Precision Agriculture\t\"Carlo Rizzardo, \n      \n      Sunny Katyara, \n      \n      Miguel Fernandes, \n      \n      Fei Chen\"\t2020/08/10\tIn recent years Sim2Real approaches have brought great results to robotics.

Current Sim2Real techniques are helpful in mitigating the problem, but for these specific tasks they are not enough.\nAgricultural Knowledge Management Using Smart Voice Messaging Systems: Combination of Physical and Human Sensors\t\"Naoshi Uchihira, \n      \n      Masami Yoshida\"\t2020/08/09\tThe use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agricultural knowledge management systems is one of the most promising approaches to increasing the efficiency of agriculture. However, the existing physical sensors in agriculture are limited for monitoring various changes in the characteristics of crops and may be expensive for the average farmer. We propose a combination of physical and human sensors (the five human senses). By using their own eyes, ears, noses, tongues, and fingers, farmers could check the various changes in the characteristics and conditions (colors of leaves, diseases, pests, faulty or malfunctioning equipment) of their crops and equipment, verbally describe their observations, and capture the descriptions with audio recording devices, such as smartphones. The voice recordings could be transcribed into text by web servers. The data captured by the physical and human sensors (voice messages) are analyzed by data and text mining to create and improve agricultural knowledge. An agricultural knowledge management system using physical and human sensors encourages to share and transfer knowledge among farmers for the purpose of improving the efficiency and productivity of agriculture. We applied one such agricultural knowledge management system (smart voice messaging system) to a greenhouse vegetable farm in Hokkaido. A qualitative analysis of accumulated voice messages and an interview with the farmer demonstrated the effectiveness of this system. The contributions of this study include a new and practical approach to an \"agricultural Internet of Everything (IoE)\" and evidence of its effectiveness as a result of our trial experiment at a real vegetable farm.\nGibbsian T-tessellation model for agricultural landscape characterization\t\"Katarzyna Adamczyk-Chauvat, \n      \n      Mouna Kassa, \n      \n      Kiên Kiêu, \n      \n      Julien Papaïx, \n      \n      Radu S. Stoica\"\t2020/07/31\tA new class of planar tessellations, named T-tessellations, was introduced in ([10]). A model was proposed to be considered as a completely random T-tessellation model (CRTT) and its Gibbsian variants were discussed. A general simulation algorithm of Metropolis-Hastings-Green type was derived for model simulation, involving three local transformations of T-tessellations. The current paper focuses on statistical inference for Gibbs models of T-tessellations. Statistical methods originated from point pattern analysis are implemented on the example of three agricultural landscapes approximated by T-tessellations. The choice of model statistics is guided by their capacity to highlight the differences between the landscape patterns. Model parameters are estimated by Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood method, yielding a baseline for landscapes comparison. In the last part of the paper a global envelope test based on the empty-space function is proposed for assessing the goodness-of-fit of the model.\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles in Smart Agriculture: Applications, Requirements and Challenges\t\"Praveen Kumar Reddy Maddikunta, \n      \n      Saqib Hakak, \n      \n      Mamoun Alazab, \n      \n      Sweta Bhattacharya, \n      \n      Thippa Reddy Gadekallu, \n      \n      Wazir Zada Khan, \n      \n      Quoc-Viet Pham\"\t2020/07/25\tIn the next few years, smart farming will reach each and every nook of the world. The prospects of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for smart farming are immense. However, the cost and the ease in controlling UAVs for smart farming might play an important role for motivating farmers to use UAVs in farming. Mostly, UAVs are controlled by remote controllers using radio waves. There are several technologies such as WiFi or ZigBee that are also used for controlling UAVs. However, Smart Bluetooth (also referred to as Bluetooth Low Energy) is a wireless technology used to transfer data over short distances. Bluetooth smart is cheaper than other technologies and has the advantage of being available on every smart phone. Farmers can use any smart phone to operate their respective UAVs along with Bluetooth Smart enabled agricultural sensors in the future. However, certain requirements and challenges need to be addressed before UAVs can be operated for smart agriculture-related applications. Hence, in this article, an attempt has been made to explore the types of sensors suitable for smart farming, potential requirements and challenges for operating UAVs in smart agriculture. We have also identified the future applications of using UAVs in smart farming.\nTowards a Sustainable Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme\tReason Lesego Machete\t2020/08/05\tSince 1986, Government of Botswana has been running an Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme for dry-land arable farming.

The scheme purports to assist dry-land crop farmers who have taken loans with participating banks or lending institutions to help them meet their debt obligations in case of crop failure due to drought, floods, frost or hailstorm. Nonetheless, to date, the scheme has focused solely on drought. The scheme has placed an unsustainable financial burden on Government because it is not based on sound actuarial principles. This paper argues that the level of Government subsidies should take into account the gains made by farmers during non-drought years. It is an attempt to circumvent the challenges of correlated climate risks and recommends a quasi self-financing mechanism, assuming that the major driver of crop yield failure is drought. Moreover, it provides a novel subsidy and premium rate setting method.\nThe Historical Impact of Anthropogenic Climate Change on Global Agricultural Productivity\t\"Ariel Ortiz-Bobea, \n      \n      Toby R. Ault, \n      \n      Carlos M. Carrillo, \n      \n      Robert G. Chambers, \n      \n      David B. Lobell\"\t2021/04/02\tAgricultural research has fostered productivity growth, but the historical influence of anthropogenic climate change on that growth has not been quantified. We develop a robust econometric model of weather effects on global agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) and combine this model with counterfactual climate scenarios to evaluate impacts of past climate trends on TFP. Our baseline model indicates that anthropogenic climate change has reduced global agricultural TFP by about 21% since 1961, a slowdown that is equivalent to losing the last 9 years of productivity growth. The effect is substantially more severe (a reduction of ~30-33%) in warmer regions such as Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. We also find that global agriculture has grown more vulnerable to ongoing climate change.\nAdoption of ICT innovations in the agriculture sector in Africa: A Systematic Literature Review\t\"Claudia Ayim, \n      \n      Ayalew Kassahun, \n      \n      Bedir Tekinerdogan, \n      \n      Chris Addison\"\t2020/06/24\tAccording to the latest World Economic Forum report, about 70% of the African population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. This makes agriculture a critical sector within the African continent. Nonetheless, agricultural productivity is low and food insecurity is still a challenge. This has in recent years led to several initiatives in using ICT (Information Communication Technology) to improve agriculture productivity. This study aims to explore ICT innovations in the agriculture sector of Africa. To achieve this, we conducted a SLR (Systematic Literature Review) of the literature published since 2010. Our search yielded 779 papers, of which 23 papers were selected for a detailed analysis following a detailed exclusion and quality assessment criteria. The analysis of the selected papers shows that the main ICT technologies adopted are text and voice-based services targeting mobile phones. The analysis also shows that radios are still widely used in disseminating agriculture information to rural farmers, while computers are mainly used by researchers. Though the mobile-based services aimed at improving access to accurate and timely agriculture information, the literature reviews indicate that the adoption of the services is constrained by poor technological infrastructure, inappropriate ICT policies and low capacity levels of users, especially farmers, to using the technologies. The findings further indicate that literature on an appropriate theoretical framework for guiding ICT innovations is lacking.\nComputer Vision with Deep Learning for Plant Phenotyping in Agriculture: A Survey\t\"Akshay L Chandra, \n      \n      Sai Vikas Desai, \n      \n      Wei Guo, \n      \n      Vineeth N Balasubramanian\"\t2020/06/18\tIn light of growing challenges in agriculture with ever growing food demand across the world, efficient crop management techniques are necessary to increase crop yield. Precision agriculture techniques allow the stakeholders to make effective and customized crop management decisions based on data gathered from monitoring crop environments. Plant phenotyping techniques play a major role in accurate crop monitoring. Advancements in deep learning have made previously difficult phenotyping tasks possible. This survey aims to introduce the reader to the state of the art research in deep plant phenotyping.\nValuing the quality option in agricultural commodity futures: a Monte Carlo simulation based approach\t\"Sanjay Mansabdar, \n      \n      Hussain C Yaganti\"\t2020/06/19\tAgricultural commodity futures are often settled by delivery. Quality options that allow the futures short to deliver one of several underlying assets are commonly used in such contracts to prevent manipulation. Inclusion of these options reduces the price of the futures contract and leads to degraded contract hedging performance. Valuation of these options is a first step in assessing the impact of the quality options embedded into a futures contract. This paper demonstrates a Monte Carlo simulation based approach to estimate the value of a quality option. In order to improve simulation efficiency, the technique of antithetic variables is used. This approach can help in the assessment of the impact of embedded quality options.\nGroup Decision Support for agriculture planning by a combination of Mathematical Model and Collaborative Tool\t\"Pascale Zaraté, \n      \n      Alemany Mme, \n      \n      Ana Esteso Alvarez, \n      \n      Amir Sakka, \n      \n      Guy Camilleri\"\t2020/06/15\tDecision making in the Agriculture domain can be a complex task.

We combine two approaches in order to support a group of farmers engaged in this kind of decision making process.

Based on this set of solution we then used a Group Decision Support System called GRUS for choosing the best solution for the group of farmers. The combined approach allows us to determine the best solution for the group in a consensual way. This combination of approaches is very innovative for the Agriculture. This approach has been tested in laboratory in a previous work. In the current work the same experiment has been conducted with real business (farmers) in order to benefit from their expertise.

Beck, \n      \n      Chen-Yi Liu, \n      \n      Christopher P. Bidinosti, \n      \n      Christopher J. Henry, \n      \n      Cara M. Godee, \n      \n      Manisha Ajmani\"\t2021/04/01\tA lack of sufficient training data, both in terms of variety and quantity, is often the bottleneck in the development of machine learning (ML) applications in any domain. For agricultural applications, ML-based models designed to perform tasks such as autonomous plant classification will typically be coupled to just one or perhaps a few plant species. As a consequence, each crop-specific task is very likely to require its own specialized training data, and the question of how to serve this need for data now often overshadows the more routine exercise of actually training such models. To tackle this problem, we have developed an embedded robotic system to automatically generate and label large datasets of plant images for ML applications in agriculture. The system can image plants from virtually any angle, thereby ensuring a wide variety of data; and with an imaging rate of up to one image per second, it can produce lableled datasets on the scale of thousands to tens of thousands of images per day. As such, this system offers an important alternative to time- and cost-intensive methods of manual generation and labeling. Furthermore, the use of a uniform background made of blue keying fabric enables additional image processing techniques such as background replacement and plant segmentation. It also helps in the training process, essentially forcing the model to focus on the plant features and eliminating random correlations. To demonstrate the capabilities of our system, we generated a dataset of over 34,000 labeled images, with which we trained an ML-model to distinguish grasses from non-grasses in test data from a variety of sources. We now plan to generate much larger datasets of Canadian crop plants and weeds that will be made publicly available in the hope of further enabling ML applications in the agriculture sector.\nFarmers' situation in agriculture markets and role of public interventions in India\tVinay Reddy Venumuddala\t2020/05/14\tIn our country, majority of agricultural workers (who may include farmers working within a cooperative framework, or those who work individually either as owners or tenants) are shown to be reaping the least amount of profits in the agriculture value chain when compared to the effort they put in. There is a good amount of literature which broadly substantiates this situation in our country. Main objective of this study is to have a broad understanding of the role played by public systems in this value chain, particularly in the segment that interacts with farmers. As a starting point, we first try to get a better understanding of how farmers are placed in a typical agriculture value chain. For this we take the help of recent seminal works on this topic that captured the situation of farmers' within certain types of value chains. Then, we isolate the segment which interacts with farmers and deep-dive into data to understand the role played by public interventions in determining farmers' income from agriculture. NSSO 70th round on Situation Assessment Survey of farmers has data pertaining to the choices of farmers and the type of their interaction with different players in the value chain. Using this data we tried to get a econometric picture of the role played by government interventions and the extent to which they determine the incomes that a typical farming household derives out of agriculture.\nEffective Data Fusion with Generalized Vegetation Index: Evidence from Land Cover Segmentation in Agriculture\t\"Hao Sheng, \n      \n      Xiao Chen, \n      \n      Jingyi Su, \n      \n      Ram Rajagopal, \n      \n      Andrew Ng\"\t2020/05/07\tHow can we effectively leverage the domain knowledge from remote sensing to better segment agriculture land cover from satellite images?

Motivated by the various Vegetation Indices (VIs), which are introduced by domain experts, we systematically reviewed the VIs that are widely used in remote sensing and their feasibility to be incorporated in deep neural networks. To fully leverage the Near-Infrared channel, the traditional Red-Green-Blue channels, and Vegetation Index or its variants, we propose a Generalized Vegetation Index (GVI), a lightweight module that can be easily plugged into many neural network architectures to serve as an additional information input. To smoothly train models with our GVI, we developed an Additive Group Normalization (AGN) module that does not require extra parameters of the prescribed neural networks. Our approach has improved the IoUs of vegetation-related classes by 0.9-1.3 percent and consistently improves the overall mIoU by 2 percent on our baseline.\nWireless Technologies for Agricultural",

Through the development of devices with low-power radios, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can be configured for almost any type of application. Agricultural has been one example where IoT and WSN have been able to increase productivity, efficiency, and output yield. Systems that previously required manual operation can be easily replaced with sensors and actuators to automate the process such as irrigation and disease management. Powering these devices is a concern as batteries are often required due to devices being located where electricity is not readily available. In this paper, a comparison is performed between three wireless technologies: IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), Long Range Wireless Area Network (LoRaWAN), and IEEE 802.11g (WiFi 2.4~GHz) for agricultural monitoring with energy harvesting capabilities. According to experimental results, LoRaWAN is the optimal technology to use in an agricultural monitoring system where power consumption and network lifetime are a priority. The experimental results can be used for the selection of wireless technology for agricultural monitoring following application requirements.\nSmall, Sparse, but Substantial: Techniques for Segmenting Small Agricultural Fields Using Sparse Ground Data\t\"Smit Marvaniya, \n      \n      Umamaheswari Devi, \n      \n      Jagabondhu Hazra, \n      \n      Shashank Mujumdar, \n      \n      Nitin Gupta\"\t2020/05/05\tThe recent thrust on digital agriculture (DA) has renewed significant research interest in the automated delineation of agricultural fields. Most prior work addressing this problem have focused on detecting medium to large fields, while there is strong evidence that around 40\\% of the fields world-wide and 70% of the fields in Asia and Africa are small. The lack of adequate labeled images for small fields, huge variations in their color, texture, and shape, and faint boundary lines separating them make it difficult to develop an end-to-end learning model for detecting such fields. Hence, in this paper, we present a multi-stage approach that uses a combination of machine learning and image processing techniques. In the first stage, we leverage state-of-the-art edge detection algorithms such as holistically-nested edge detection (HED) to extract first-level contours and polygons. In the second stage, we propose image-processing techniques to identify polygons that are non-fields, over-segmentations, or noise and eliminate them. The next stage tackles under-segmentations using a combination of a novel ``cut-point'' based technique and localized second-level edge detection to obtain individual parcels. Since a few small, non-cropped but vegetated or constructed pockets can be interspersed in areas that are predominantly croplands, in the final stage, we train a classifier for identifying each parcel from the previous stage as an agricultural field or not. In an evaluation using high-resolution imagery, we show that our approach has a high F-Score of 0.84 in areas with large fields and reasonable accuracy with an F-Score of 0.73 in areas with small fields, which is encouraging.\nUAV and Machine Learning Based Refinement of a Satellite-Driven Vegetation Index for Precision Agriculture\t\"Vittorio Mazzia, \n      \n      Lorenzo Comba, \n      \n      Aleem Khaliq, \n      \n      Marcello Chiaberge, \n      \n      Paolo Gay\"\t2020/04/29\tPrecision agriculture is considered to be a fundamental approach in pursuing a low-input, high-efficiency, and sustainable kind of agriculture when performing site-specific management practices. To achieve this objective, a reliable and updated description of the local status of crops is required. Remote sensing, and in particular satellite-based imagery, proved to be a valuable tool in crop mapping, monitoring, and diseases assessment. However, freely available satellite imagery with low or moderate resolutions showed some limits in specific agricultural applications, e.g., where crops are grown by rows. Indeed, in this framework, the satellite's output could be biased by intra-row covering, giving inaccurate information about crop status. This paper presents a novel satellite imagery refinement framework, based on a deep learning technique which exploits information properly derived from high resolution images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multispectral sensors. To train the convolutional neural network, only a single UAV-driven dataset is required, making the proposed approach simple and cost-effective. A vineyard in Serralunga d'Alba (Northern Italy) was chosen as a case study for validation purposes. Refined satellite-driven normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps, acquired in four different periods during the vine growing season, were shown to better describe crop status with respect to raw datasets by correlation analysis and ANOVA. In addition, using a K-means based classifier, 3-class vineyard vigor maps were profitably derived from the NDVI maps, which are a valuable tool for growers.\nEstimating the Demand Factors and Willingness to Pay for Agricultural Insurance\tOsman Gulseven\t2020/03/12\tThis article investigates the effect of prices and socio-demographic variables on the farmers decision to purchase agricultural insurance.

A survey has been conducted to 200 farmers most of whom are engaged in diversified income-generating activities. The logistic estimation results suggest that education and household income from farming activities positively affect the likelihood of purchasing insurance. The demand for insurance is negatively correlated with the premium paid per insured value, suggesting that insurance is a normal good. Farmers are willing to pay (WTP) increasingly higher premiums for contracts with a higher coverage ratio. According to the valuation model, the WTP declines sharply for coverage ratios under 70%.\nProceedings of the ICLR Workshop on Computer Vision for Agriculture (CV4A) 2020\t\"Yannis Kalantidis, \n      \n      Laura Sevilla-Lara, \n      \n      Ernest Mwebaze, \n      \n      Dina Machuve, \n      \n      Hamed Alemohammad, \n      \n      David Guerena\"\t2020/05/17\t\"This is the proceedings of the Computer Vision for Agriculture (CV4A) Workshop that was held in conjunction with the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2020.\n  The Computer Vision for Agriculture (CV4A) 2020 workshop was scheduled to be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on April 26th, 2020.

Around 57 participating teams from various countries compete to achieve state-of-the-art in aerial agriculture semantic segmentation. The Agriculture-Vision Challenge Dataset was employed, which comprises of 21,061 aerial and multi-spectral farmland images. This paper provides a summary of notable methods and results in the challenge.

The annotation tool introduces novel methods for labeling with a variety of manual, semi-automatic, and fully-automatic tools. The dataset includes original images collected from commercial greenhouses, images from PlantVillage, and images from Google Images. Images were annotated with segmentations for foreground leaf, fruit, and stem instances, and diseased leaf area. Labels were in an extended COCO format. In total the dataset contained 10k tomatoes, 7k leaves, 2k stems, and 2k diseased leaf annotations.\nTransfer Learning of Photometric Phenotypes in Agriculture Using Metadata\t\"Dan Halbersberg, \n      \n      Aharon Bar Hillel, \n      \n      Shon Mendelson, \n      \n      Daniel Koster, \n      \n      Lena Karol, \n      \n      Boaz Lerner\"\t2020/04/01\tEstimation of photometric plant phenotypes (e.g., hue, shine, chroma) in field conditions is important for decisions on the expected yield quality, fruit ripeness, and need for further breeding. Estimating these from images is difficult due to large variances in lighting conditions, shadows, and sensor properties. We combine the image and metadata regarding capturing conditions embedded into a network, enabling more accurate estimation and transfer between different conditions. Compared to a state-of-the-art deep CNN and a human expert, metadata embedding improves the estimation of the tomato's hue and chroma.\nIndemnity Payments in Agricultural Insurance: Risk Exposure of EU States\t\"Osman Gulseven, \n      \n      Kasirga Yildirak\"\t2020/03/12\tThis study estimates the risk contributions of individual European countries regarding the indemnity payments in agricultural insurance.

Ngo, \n      \n      M-Tahar Kechadi\"\t2020/03/10\tNowadays, the agricultural data can be generated through various sources, such as: Internet of Thing (IoT), sensors, satellites, weather stations, robots, farm equipment, agricultural laboratories, farmers, government agencies and agribusinesses. The analysis of this big data enables farmers, companies and agronomists to extract high business and scientific knowledge, improving their operational processes and product quality. However, before analysing this data, different data sources need to be normalised, homogenised and integrated into a unified data representation. In this paper, we propose an agricultural data integration method using a constellation schema which is designed to be flexible enough to incorporate other datasets and big data models. We also apply some methods to extract knowledge with the view to improve crop yield; these include finding suitable quantities of soil properties, herbicides and insecticides for both increasing crop yield and protecting the environment.\nCopula-based local dependence between energy, agriculture and metal commodity markets\t\"Claudiu Albulescu, \n      \n      Aviral Tiwari, \n      \n      Qiang Ji\"\t2020/03/09\tThis paper studies the extreme dependencies between energy, agriculture and metal commodity markets, with a focus on local co-movements, allowing the identification of asymmetries and changing trend in the degree of co-movements. More precisely, starting from a non-parametric mixture copula, we use a novel copula-based local Kendall's tau approach to measure nonlinear local dependence in regions. In all pairs of commodity indexes, we find increased co-movements in extreme situations, a stronger dependence between energy and other commodity markets at lower tails, and a 'V-type' local dependence for the energy-metal pairs. The three-dimensional Kendall's tau plot for upper tails in quantiles shows asymmetric co-movements in the energy-metal pairs, which tend to become negative at peak returns. Therefore, we show that the energy market can offer diversification solutions for risk management in the case of extreme bull market events.\nImproving Pest Monitoring Networks in order to reduce pesticide use in agriculture\t\"Marie-Josée Cros, \n      \n      Jean-Noël Aubertot, \n      \n      Sabrina Gaba, \n      \n      Xavier Reboud, \n      \n      Régis Sabbadin, \n      \n      Nathalie Peyrard\"\t2020/02/03\tDisease and pest control largely rely on pesticides use and progress still remains to be made towards more sustainable practices. Pest Monitoring Networks (PMNs) can provide useful information for improving crop protection by restricting pesticide use to the situations that best require it. However, the efficacy of a PMN to control pests may depend on its spatial density and space/time sampling balance. Furthermore the best trade-off between the monitoring effort and the impact of the PMN information may be pest dependent. We developed a generic simulation model that links PMN information to treatment decisions and pest dynamics. We derived the number of treatments, the epidemic extension and the global gross margin for different families of pests. For soil-borne pathogens and weeds, we found that increasing the spatial density of a PMN significantly decreased the number of treatments (up to 67\\%), with an only marginal increase in infection. Considering past observations had a second-order effect (up to a 13\\% decrease). For the spatial scale of our study, the PMN information had practically no influence in the case of insects. The next step is to go beyond PMN analysis to design and chose among sustainable management strategies at the landscape scale.\nArtificial Intelligence for Digital Agriculture at Scale: Techniques, Policies, and Challenges\t\"Somali Chaterji, \n      \n      Nathan DeLay, \n      \n      John Evans, \n      \n      Nathan Mosier, \n      \n      Bernard Engel, \n      \n      Dennis Buckmaster, \n      \n      Ranveer Chandra\"\t2020/01/21\tDigital agriculture has the promise to transform agricultural throughput. It can do this by applying data science and engineering for mapping input factors to crop throughput, while bounding the available resources. In addition, as the data volumes and varieties increase with the increase in sensor deployment in agricultural fields, data engineering techniques will also be instrumental in collection of distributed data as well as distributed processing of the data. These have to be done such that the latency requirements of the end users and applications are satisfied. Understanding how farm technology and big data can improve farm productivity can significantly increase the world's food production by 2050 in the face of constrained arable land and with the water levels receding. While much has been written about digital agriculture's potential, little is known about the economic costs and benefits of these emergent systems. In particular, the on-farm decision making processes, both in terms of adoption and optimal implementation, have not been adequately addressed. For example, if some algorithm needs data from multiple data owners to be pooled together, that raises the question of data ownership.

Huang, \n      \n      Honghui Shi\"\t2020/03/19\tThe success of deep learning in visual recognition tasks has driven advancements in multiple fields of research. Particularly, increasing attention has been drawn towards its application in agriculture. Nevertheless, while visual pattern recognition on farmlands carries enormous economic values, little progress has been made to merge computer vision and crop sciences due to the lack of suitable agricultural image datasets. Meanwhile, problems in agriculture also pose new challenges in computer vision. For example, semantic segmentation of aerial farmland images requires inference over extremely large-size images with extreme annotation sparsity. These challenges are not present in most of the common object datasets, and we show that they are more challenging than many other aerial image datasets. To encourage research in computer vision for agriculture, we present Agriculture-Vision: a large-scale aerial farmland image dataset for semantic segmentation of agricultural patterns. We collected 94,986 high-quality aerial images from 3,432 farmlands across the US, where each image consists of RGB and Near-infrared (NIR) channels with resolution as high as 10 cm per pixel. We annotate nine types of field anomaly patterns that are most important to farmers. As a pilot study of aerial agricultural semantic segmentation, we perform comprehensive experiments using popular semantic segmentation models; we also propose an effective model designed for aerial agricultural pattern recognition. Our experiments demonstrate several challenges Agriculture-Vision poses to both the computer vision and agriculture communities. Future versions of this dataset will include even more aerial images, anomaly patterns and image channels.

Griepentrog\"\t2019/12/01\tA current problem in the design of small and lightweight autonomous agricultural robots is how to create sufficient traction on soil to pull an agricultural implement or load. One promising solution is offered by the interlock drive system, which penetrates spikes into the soil to create traction. The combination of soil penetrating spikes and a push-pull design offers new possibilities for vehicle control. By controlling the interlocking of the spikes and pushing and pulling them against the main frame, the vehicle can perform tight maneuvers. To validate this idea, we designed a robot, capable of creating high traction and performing headland turns. The navigation of the new robot system is performed by actively pushing the spikes, mounted on a slide into the soil, while the main frame is pushed back and pulled forward. The vehicle of 2-meter length was able to turn on the spot, and could follow a straight line, just using the spikes and the push-pull mechanism. The trajectory and the performed measurements suggest, that a vehicle which uses only spikes for traction and steering is fully capable of performing autonomous tasks in agriculture fields.\nData Preparation in Agriculture Through Automated Semantic Annotation -- Basis for a Wide Range of Smart Services\t\"Julian Klose, \n      \n      Markus Schröder, \n      \n      Silke Becker, \n      \n      Ansgar Bernardi, \n      \n      Arno Ruckelshausen\"\t2019/11/15\tModern agricultural technology and the increasing digitalisation of such processes provide a wide range of data.

This topic is motivated by two observations. Due to crossings of tyre traces such transitions in practice often cause an increase of compacted area. Furthermore, for very tight angles between headland path and interior lanes undesired hairpin turns may become necessary due to the limited agility of in-field operating tractors. By minimising the number of interior lanes both detrimental effects can be mitigated. The potential of minimising the number of interior lanes by freeform path fitting is evaluated on 10 non-convex real-world fields including obstacle areas, and compared to the more common technique of fitting straight interior lanes.\nDesign and Implementation of a Wireless SensorNetwork for Agricultural Applications\t\"Jobish John, \n      \n      Gaurav S Kasbekar, \n      \n      Dinesh K Sharma, \n      \n      V. Ramulu, \n      \n      Maryam Shojaei Baghini\"\t2019/10/22\tWe present the design and implementation of a shortest path tree based, energy efficient data collection wireless sensor network to sense various parameters in an agricultural farm using in-house developed low cost sensors. Nodes follow a synchronized, periodic sleep-wake up schedule to maximize the lifetime of the network. The implemented network consists of 24 sensor nodes in a 3 acre maize farm and its performance is captured by 7 snooper nodes for different data collection intervals: 10 minutes, 1 hour and 3 hours. The almost static nature of wireless links in the farm motivated us to use the same tree for a long data collection period(3 days). The imbalance in energy consumption across nodes is observed to be very small and the network architecture uses easy-to-implement protocols to perform different network activities including handling of node failures. We present the results and analysis of extensive tests conducted on our implementation, which provide significant insights.\nComparative study of panel and panelless-based reflectance conversion techniques for agricultural remote sensing\t\"Baabak Mamaghani, \n      \n      Carl Salvaggio\"\t2019/10/08\tSmall unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) have allowed for thousands of aerial images to be captured at a moments notice. The simplicity and relative low cost of flying a sUAS has provided remote sensing practitioners, both commercial and academic, with a viable alternative to traditional remote sensing platforms (airplanes and satellites). This paper is an expanded follow-up study to an initial work. Three radiance-to-reflectance conversion methods were tested to determine the optimal technique to use for converting raw digital count imagery to reflectance maps. The first two methods utilized in-scene reflectance conversion panels along with the empirical line method (ELM), while the final method used an upward looking sensor that recorded the band-effective spectral downwelling irradiance. The methods employed were 2-Point ELM, 1-point ELM, and At-altitude Radiance Ratio (AARR). The average signed reflectance factor errors produced by these methods on real sUAS imagery were: -0.005, -0.0028, and -0.0244 respectively. These errors were produced across four altitudes (150, 225, 300 and 375ft), six targets (grass, asphalt, concrete, blue felt, green felt and red felt), five spectral bands (blue, green, red, red edge and near infrared), and three weather conditions (cloudy, partly cloudy and sunny). Finally, data was simulated using the MODTRAN code to generate downwelling irradiance and sensor reaching radiance to compute the theoretical results of the AARR technique. A multitude of variables were varied for these simulations (atmosphere, time, day, target, sensor height, and visibility), which resulted in an overall theoretically achievable signed reflectance factor error of 0.0023.\nUsing Digital Field Experiments To Elicit Risk Mitigation Behavioral Strategies For Disease Management Across Agricultural Production Systems\t\"Eric M.

Thus, an examination of the decision making processes associated with investment in biosecurity is important for enhancing system wide biosecurity. Data gathered from digital field experiments can provide insights into behavioral strategies and inform the development of decision support systems. We created an online digital experiment to simulate outbreak scenarios among swine production supply chains, where participants were tasked with making biosecurity investment decisions. In Experiment One, we quantified the risk associated with each participant's decisions and delineated three dominant categories of risk attitudes: risk averse, risk tolerant, and opportunistic. Each risk class exhibited unique approaches in reaction to risk and disease information. We also tested how information uncertainty affects risk aversion, by varying the amount of visibility of the infection as well as the amount of biosecurity implemented across the system. We found evidence that more visibility in the number of infected sites increases risk averse behaviors, while more visibility in the amount of neighboring biosecurity increased risk taking behaviors. In Experiment Two, we were surprised to find no evidence for differences in behavior of livestock specialists compared to Amazon Mechanical Turk participants. Our findings provide support for using digital field experiments to study how risk communication affects behavior, which can provide insights towards more effective messaging strategies.\nEffects of green revolution led agricultural expansion on net ecosystem service values in India\t\"Srikanta Sannigrahi, \n      \n      Suman Chakraborti, \n      \n      Pawan Kumar Joshi, \n      \n      Saskia Keesstra, \n      \n      P.

The expansion of cultivation and cropland, which is the backbone of the Indian economy, is one of the main drivers of rapid Land Use Land Cover changes in India. To assess the impact of the Green Revolution led agrarian expansion on the total ecosystem service values, we first estimated the ESVs from 1985 to 2005 for eight ecoregions in India using several value transfer approaches. Five explanatory factors such as Total Crop Area, Crop Production, Crop Yield, Net Irrigated Area, and Cropping Intensity representing the cropping scenarios in the country were used in constructing local Geographical Weighted Regression model to explore the cumulative and individual effects on ESVs. A Multi-Layer Perceptron based Artificial Neural Network algorithm was employed to estimate the normalized importance of these explanatory factors. During the observation periods, cropland, forestland, and water bodies have contributed the most and form a significant proportion of ESVs, followed by grassland, mangrove, wetland, and urban builtup. In all three years, among the nine ESs, the highest ESV accounts for water regulation, followed by soil formation and soilwater retention, biodiversity maintenance, waste treatment, climate regulation, and gas regulation. Among the five explanatory factors, TCA, NIA, CP showed a strong positive association with ESVs, while the CI exhibited a negative association. The study reveals a strong association between GR led agricultural expansion and ESVs in India.\nCentrality-oriented Causality -- A Study of EU Agricultural Subsidies and Digital Developement in Poland\t\"Kosiorowski Daniel, \n      \n      Jerzy P. Rydlewski\"\t2019/09/16\tResults of a convincing causal statistical inference related to socio-economic phenomena are treated as especially desired background for conducting various socio-economic programs or government interventions. Unfortunately, quite often real socio-economic issues do not fulfill restrictive assumptions of procedures of causal analysis proposed in the literature. This paper indicates certain empirical challenges and conceptual opportunities related to applications of procedures of data depth concept into a process of causal inference as to socio-economic phenomena. We show, how to apply a statistical functional depths in order to indicate factual and counterfactual distributions commonly used within procedures of causal inference. Thus a modification of Rubin causality concept is proposed, i.e., a centrality-oriented causality concept. The presented framework is especially useful in a context of conducting causal inference basing on official statistics, i.e., basing on already existing databases. Methodological considerations related to extremal depth, modified band depth, Fraiman-Muniz depth, and multivariate Wilcoxon sum rank statistic are illustrated by means of example related to a study of an impact of EU direct agricultural subsidies on a digital development in Poland in a period of 2012-2019.\nEarly Classification for Agricultural Monitoring from Satellite Time Series\t\"Marc Rußwurm, \n      \n      Romain Tavenard, \n      \n      Sébastien Lefèvre, \n      \n      Marco Körner\"\t2019/08/27\tIn this work, we introduce a recently developed early classification mechanism to satellite-based agricultural monitoring.

Our findings indicate that blockchain is a promising technology towards a transparent supply chain of food, with many ongoing initiatives in various food products and food-related issues, but many barriers and challenges still exist, which hinder its wider popularity among farmers and systems. These challenges involve technical aspects, education, policies and regulatory frameworks.\nTowards Active Robotic Vision in Agriculture: A Deep Learning Approach to Visual Servoing in Occluded and Unstructured Protected Cropping Environments\t\"Paul Zapotezny-Anderson, \n      \n      Chris Lehnert\"\t2019/08/05\t3D Move To See (3DMTS) is a mutli-perspective visual servoing method for unstructured and occluded environments, like that encountered in robotic crop harvesting. This paper presents a deep learning method, Deep-3DMTS for creating a single-perspective approach for 3DMTS through the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The novel method is developed and validated via simulation against the standard 3DMTS approach. The Deep-3DMTS approach is shown to have performance equivalent to the standard 3DMTS baseline in guiding the end effector of a robotic arm to improve the view of occluded fruit (sweet peppers): end effector final position within 11.4 mm of the baseline; and an increase in fruit size in the image by a factor of 17.8 compared to the baseline of 16.8 (avg.).\nThe Use of Agricultural Robots in Orchard Management\t\"Qin Zhang, \n      \n      Manoj Karkee, \n      \n      Amy Tabb\"\t2019/07/30\tBook chapter that summarizes recent research on agricultural robotics in orchard management, including Robotic pruning, Robotic thinning, Robotic spraying, Robotic harvesting, Robotic fruit transportation, and future trends.\nODE network model for nonlinear and complex agricultural nutrient solution system\t\"Byunghyun Ban, \n      \n      Minwoo Lee, \n      \n      Donghun Ryu\"\t2019/09/02\tIn closed hydroponic systems, periodic readjustment of nutrient solution is necessary to continuously provide stable environment to plant roots because the interaction between plant and nutrient solution changes the rate of ions in it. The traditional method is to repeat supplying small amount of premade concentrated nutrient solution, measuring total electric conductivity and pH of the tank only. As it cannot control the collapse of ion rates, recent researches try to measure the concentration of individual components to provide insufficient ions only. However, those approaches use titrationlike heuristic approaches, which repeat adding small amount of components and measuring ion density a lot of times for a single control input. Both traditional and recent methods are not only time-consuming, but also cannot predict chemical reactions related with control inputs because the nutrient solution is a nonlinear complex system, including many precipitation reactions and complicated interactions. We present a continuous network model of the nutrient solution system, whose reactions are described as differential equations. The model predicts molar concentration of each chemical components and total dissolved solids with low error. This model also can calculate the amount of chemical compounds needed to produce a desired nutrient solution, by reverse calculation from dissolved ion concentrations.\nMachine learning approach to remove ion interference effect in agricultural nutrient solutions\t\"Byunghyun Ban, \n      \n      Donghun Ryu, \n      \n      Minwoo Lee\"\t2019/09/02\tHigh concentration agricultural facilities such as vertical farms or plant factories consider hydroponic techniques as optimal solutions. Although closed-system dramatically reduces water consumption and pollution issues, it has ion-ratio related problem. As the root absorbs individual ions with different rate, ion rate in a nutrient solution should be adjusted periodically. But traditional method only considers pH and electrical conductivity to adjust the nutrient solution, leading to ion imbalance and accumulation of excessive salts. To avoid those problems, some researchers have proposed ion-balancing methods which measure and control each ion concentration. However, those approaches do not overcome the innate limitations of ISEs, especially ion interference effect. An anion sensor is affected by other anions, and the error grows larger in higher concentration solution. A machine learning approach to modify ISE data distorted by ion interference effect is proposed in this paper. As measurement of TDS value is relatively robust than any other signals, we applied TDS as key parameter to build a readjustment function to remove the artifact. Once a readjustment model is established, application on ISE data can be done in real time. Readjusted data with proposed model showed about 91.6 ~ 98.3% accuracies. This method will enable the fields to apply recent methods in feasible status.\nA Framework",

In recent years, ontologies have become a major tool for domain knowledge representation and a core component of many knowledge management systems, decision support systems and other intelligent systems, inter alia, in the context of agriculture. A review of the existing literature on agricultural ontologies, however, reveals that most of the studies, which propose agricultural ontologies, are lacking an explicit evaluation procedure. This is undesired because without well-structured evaluation processes, it is difficult to consider the value of ontologies to research and practice. Moreover, it is difficult to rely on such ontologies and share them on the Semantic Web or between semantic aware applications. With the growing number of ontology-based agricultural systems and the increasing popularity of the Semantic Web, it becomes essential that such development and evaluation methods are put forward to guide future efforts of ontology development. Our work contributes to the literature on agricultural ontologies, by presenting a method for evaluating agricultural ontologies, which seems to be missing from most existing studies on agricultural ontologies. The framework supports the matching of appropriate evaluation methods for a given ontology based on the ontology's purpose.\nAgriculture Commodity Arrival Prediction using Remote Sensing Data: Insights and Beyond\t\"Gautam Prasad, \n      \n      Upendra Reddy Vuyyuru, \n      \n      Mithun Das Gupta\"\t2019/06/14\t\"In developing countries like India agriculture plays an extremely important role in the lives of the population. In India, around 80\\% of the population depend on agriculture or its by-products as the primary means for employment. Given large population dependency on agriculture, it becomes extremely important for the government to estimate market factors in advance and prepare for any deviation from those estimates. Commodity arrivals to market is an extremely important factor which is captured at district level throughout the country. Historical data and short-term prediction of important variables such as arrivals, prices, crop quality etc. for commodities are used by the government to take proactive steps and decide various policy measures.\n  In this paper, we present a framework to work with short timeseries in conjunction with remote sensing data to predict future commodity arrivals. We deal with extremely high dimensional data which exceed the observation sizes by multiple orders of magnitude. We use cascaded layers of dimensionality reduction techniques combined with regularized regression models for prediction. We present results to predict arrivals to major markets and state wide prices for `Tur' (red gram) crop in Karnataka, India. Our model consistently beats popular ML techniques on many instances. Our model is scalable, time efficient and can be generalized to many other crops and regions. We draw multiple insights from the regression parameters, some of which are important aspects to consider when predicting more complex quantities such as prices in the future. We also combine the insights to generate important recommendations for different government organizations.\"\nCo-modelling of Agricultural Robotic Systems\tMartin Peter Christiansen\t2019/06/17\tAutomated and robotic ground-vehicle solutions are gradually becoming part of the agricultural industry, where they are used for performing tasks such as feeding, herding, planting, harvesting, and weed spraying. Agricultural machinery operates in both indoor and outdoor farm environments, resulting in changing operational conditions. Variation in the load transported by ground-vehicles is a common occurrence in the agricultural domain, in tasks such as animal feeding and field spraying. The development of automated and robotic ground-vehicle solutions for conditions and scenarios in the agricultural domain is a complex task, which requires input from multiple engineering disciplines. This PhD thesis proposes modelling and simulation for the research and development of automated and robotic ground-vehicle solutions for purposes such as component development, virtual prototype testing, and scenario evaluation. The collaboration of multiple engineering disciplines is achieved by combining multiple modelling and simulation tools from different engineering disciplines. These combined models are known as co-models and their execution is referred to as co-simulation. The results of this thesis are a model-based development methodology for automated and robotic ground-vehicles utilised for a number of research and development cases. The co-models of the automated and robotic ground vehicles were created using the model-based development methodology, and they contribute to the future development support in this research domain. The thesis presents four contributions toward the exploration of a chosen design space for an automated or robotic ground vehicle. Solutions obtained using co-modelling and co-simulation are deployed to their ground-vehicle realisations, which ensures that all stages of development are covered.\nSmart Sustainable Agriculture (SSA) Solution Underpinned by Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\tEissa Alreshidi\t2019/05/30\tThe Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been employed in agriculture over a long period of time, alongside other advanced computing technologies.

Various applications have been proposed and validated so far for environmental monitoring, security and industrial control systems. One particular application domain has been shown suitable for the requirements of precision agriculture where such systems can improve yields, increase efficiency and reduce input usage. We present a data analysis and processing approach for distributed monitoring of crops and soil where hierarchical aggregation and modelling primitives contribute to the robustness of the network by alleviating communication bottlenecks and reducing the energy required for redundant data transmissions. The focus is on leveraging the fog computing paradigm to exploit local node computing resources and generate events towards upper decision systems. Key metrics are reported which highlight the improvements achieved. A case study is carried out on real field data for crop and soil monitoring with outlook on operational and implementation constraints.\nDesigning and Implementing Data Warehouse for Agricultural Big Data\t\"Vuong M. Ngo, \n      \n      Nhien-An Le-Khac, \n      \n      M-Tahar Kechadi\"\t2019/05/29\tIn recent years, precision agriculture that uses modern information and communication technologies is becoming very popular. Raw and semi-processed agricultural data are usually collected through various sources, such as: Internet of Thing (IoT), sensors, satellites, weather stations, robots, farm equipment, farmers and agribusinesses, etc. Besides, agricultural datasets are very large, complex, unstructured, heterogeneous, non-standardized, and inconsistent. Hence, the agricultural data mining is considered as Big Data application in terms of volume, variety, velocity and veracity. It is a key foundation to establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will enable resource efficient agronomy decision making and recommendations. In this paper, we designed and implemented a continental level agricultural data warehouse by combining Hive, MongoDB and Cassandra. Our data warehouse capabilities: (1) flexible schema; (2) data integration from real agricultural multi datasets; (3) data science and business intelligent support; (4) high performance; (5) high storage; (6) security; (7) governance and monitoring; (8) replication and recovery; (9) consistency, availability and partition tolerant; (10) distributed and cloud deployment. We also evaluate the performance of our data warehouse.\nCultivating Online: Question Routing in a Question and Answering Community for Agriculture\t\"Xiaoxue Shen, \n      \n      Liyang Gu, \n      \n      Adele Lu Jia\"\t2020/02/17\t\"Community-based Question and Answering (CQA) platforms are nowadays enlightening over a billion people with crowdsourced knowledge. A key design issue in CQA platforms is how to find the potential answerers and to provide the askers timely and suitable answers, i.e., the so-called \\textit{question routing} problem. State-of-art approaches often rely on extracting topics from the question texts. In this work, we analyze the question routing problem in a CQA system named Farm-Doctor that is exclusive for agricultural knowledge. The major challenge is that its questions contain limited textual information.\n  To this end, we conduct an extensive measurement and obtain the whole knowledge repository of Farm-Doctor that consists of over 690 thousand questions and over 3 million answers. To remedy the text deficiency, we model Farm-Doctor as a heterogeneous information network that incorporates rich side information and based on network representation learning models we accurately recommend for each question the users that are highly likely to answer it. With an average income of fewer than 6 dollars a day, over 300 thousands farmers in China seek online in Farm-Doctor for agricultural advices. Our method helps these less eloquent farmers with their cultivation and hopefully provides a way to improve their lives.\"\nMathematical modeling for sustainable aphid control in agriculture via intercropping\t\"Alfonso Allen-Perkins, \n      \n      Ernesto Estrada\"\t2019/05/12\tAgricultural losses to pest represent an important challenge in a global warming scenario. Intercropping is an alternative farming practice that promotes pest control without the use of chemical pesticides. Here we develop a mathematical model to study epidemic spreading and control in intercropped agricultural fields as a sustainable pest management tool for agriculture.

Aragón, \n      \n      Francisco Oteiza, \n      \n      Juan Pablo Rud\"\t2019/02/28\tThis paper examines how subsistence farmers respond to extreme heat. Using micro-data from Peruvian households, we find that high temperatures reduce agricultural productivity, increase area planted, and change crop mix. These findings are consistent with farmers using input adjustments as a short-term mechanism to attenuate the effect of extreme heat on output. This response seems to complement other coping strategies, such as selling livestock, but exacerbates the drop in yields, a standard measure of agricultural productivity. Using our estimates, we show that accounting for land adjustments is important to quantify damages associated with climate change.\nPredicting US State-Level Agricultural Sentiment as a Measure of Food Security with Tweets from Farming Communities\t\"Jared Dunnmon, \n      \n      Swetava Ganguli, \n      \n      Darren Hau, \n      \n      Brooke Husic\"\t2019/04/25\tThe ability to obtain accurate food security metrics in developing areas where relevant data can be sparse is critically important for policy makers tasked with implementing food aid programs. As a result, a great deal of work has been dedicated to predicting important food security metrics such as annual crop yields using a variety of methods including simulation, remote sensing, weather models, and human expert input. As a complement to existing techniques in crop yield prediction, this work develops neural network models for predicting the sentiment of Twitter feeds from farming communities. Specifically, we investigate the potential of both direct learning on a small dataset of agriculturally-relevant tweets and transfer learning from larger, well-labeled sentiment datasets from other domains (e.g.~politics) to accurately predict agricultural sentiment, which we hope would ultimately serve as a useful crop yield predictor. We find that direct learning from small, relevant datasets outperforms transfer learning from large, fully-labeled datasets, that convolutional neural networks broadly outperform recurrent neural networks on Twitter sentiment classification, and that these models perform substantially less well on ternary sentiment problems characteristic of practical settings than on binary problems often found in the literature.\nRobotic Tankette for Intelligent BioEnergy Agriculture: Design, Development and Field Tests\t\"Marco F.

From\"\t2019/01/03\tIn recent years, the use of robots in agriculture has been increasing mainly due to the high demand of productivity, precision and efficiency, which follow the climate change effects and world population growth. Unlike conventional agriculture, sugarcane farms are usually regions with dense vegetation, gigantic areas, and subjected to extreme weather conditions, such as intense heat, moisture and rain. TIBA - Tankette for Intelligent BioEnergy Agriculture - is the first result of an R&D project which strives to develop an autonomous mobile robotic system for carrying out a number of agricultural tasks in sugarcane fields. The proposed concept consists of a semi-autonomous, low-cost, dust and waterproof tankette-type vehicle, capable of infiltrating dense vegetation in plantation tunnels and carry several sensing systems, in order to perform mapping of hard-to-access areas and collecting samples. This paper presents an overview of the robot mechanical design, the embedded electronics and software architecture, and the construction of a first prototype. Preliminary results obtained in field tests validate the proposed conceptual design and bring about several challenges and potential applications for robot autonomous navigation, as well as to build a new prototype with additional functionality.\nGeometrical Stem Detection from Image Data for Precision Agriculture\t\"F.

Stachniss\"\t2018/12/13\tHigh efficiency in precision farming depends on accurate tools to perform weed detection and mapping of crops. This allows for precise removal of harmful weeds with a lower amount of pesticides, as well as increase of the harvest's yield by providing the farmer with valuable information. In this paper, we address the problem of fully automatic stem detection from image data for this purpose. Our approach runs on mobile agricultural robots taking RGB images. After processing the images to obtain a vegetation mask, our approach separates each plant into its individual leaves and later estimates a precise stem position. This allows an upstream mapping algorithm to add the high-resolution stem positions as a semantic aggregate to the global map of the robot, which can be used for weeding and for analyzing crop statistics. We implemented our approach and thoroughly tested it on three different datasets with vegetation masks and stem position ground truth. The experiments presented in this paper conclude that our module is able to detect leaves and estimate the stem's position at a rate of 56 Hz on a single CPU. We furthermore provide the software to the community.\nModelling Social Evolutionary Processes and Peer Effects in Agricultural Trade Networks: the Rubber Value Chain in Indonesia\t\"Thomas Kopp, \n      \n      Jan Salecker\"\t2018/11/28\tUnderstanding market participants' channel choices is important to policy makers because it yields",

These channel choices are the result of a recursive process of social interactions and determine the observable trading networks. They are characterized by feedback mechanisms due to peer interaction and therefore need to be understood as complex adaptive systems (CAS). When modelling CAS, conventional approaches like regression analyses face severe drawbacks since endogeneity is omnipresent. As an alternative, process-based analyses allow researchers to capture these endogenous processes and multiple feedback loops. This paper applies an agent-based modelling approach (ABM) to the empirical example of the Indonesian rubber trade. The feedback mechanisms are modelled via an innovative approach of a social matrix, which allows decisions made in a specific period to feed back into the decision processes in subsequent periods, and allows agents to systematically assign different weights to the decision parameters based on their individual characteristics. In the validation against the observed network, uncertainty in the found estimates, as well as under determination of the model, are dealt with via an approach of evolutionary calibration: a genetic algorithm finds the combination of parameters that maximizes the similarity between the simulated and the observed network. Results indicate that the sellers' channel choice decisions are mostly driven by physical distance and debt obligations, as well as peer-interaction. Within the social matrix, the most influential individuals are sellers that live close by to other traders, are active in social groups and belong to the ethnic majority in their village.\nModeling of raining season onset and cessation of tropical rainfall for climate change adaptation in Agriculture\t\"I. A. Fuwape, \n      \n      S. T.

Daily data was obtained from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency for thirty-four (34) years (1979 - 2013). ROD and RCD were computed using the method of cumulative percentage mean rainfall values. Maiduguri, Gusau and Ikom showed positive trends in ROD and RCD while Ibadan exhibited negative trends in the two parameters. Anti-persistence was observed in ROD, RCD and LGS for three locations (Maiduguri, Gusau and Ibadan). A Fourier based model with seven (7) coefficients was developed to model ROD and RCD for all the locations. The model developed performed very well in all locations with the best performance obtained in Gusau and Ibadan for ROD and RCD respectively. The effects of climate change on agricultural output for the four (4) locations under consideration were highlighted and adaption techniques suggested for mitigating the impact on agricultural output and livelihood of citizens in the areas.\nOntology based Approach for Precision Agriculture\t\"Quoc Hung Ngo, \n      \n      Nhien-An Le-Khac, \n      \n      Tahar Kechadi\"\t2018/11/16\tIn this paper, we propose a framework of knowledge for an agriculture ontology which can be used for the purpose of smart agriculture systems.

The microalgal biomass produced in the PBRs was harvested in a static lamella settling tank. Each PBR treated in average 2.3 m3/d. PBRs were submitted to strong seasonal changes regarding solar radiation and temperature, which had a direct impact in the activity of microalgae and the efficiency of the system. Higher mixed liquor pH values were registered in summer (daily average> 10). Most of the influent and effluent nitrogen content was inorganic (average of 9.0 mg N/L and 3.17 mg N/L, respectively), and in the form of nitrate (62% and 50%, respectively). Average nitrogen removal efficiency was 65%, with values of around 90% in summer, 80% in autumn, 50 % in winter and 60% in spring. Most of the influent and effluent phosphorus content was in the form of ortophosphate. Influent average was 0.62 mg P/L, but with great variations and in a considerable number of samples not detected. Removal efficiency (when influent values were detected) was very high during all the study, usually greater than 95%, and there were not clear seasonal trends for efficiency as observed for TIN. Volumetric biomass production greatly changed between seasons with much lower values in winter (7 g VSS/m3d) than in summer (43 g VSS/m3d).

Drainage channels do receive these polluted waters, but its introduction in the conventional treatment network is unfeasible. Within this context, microalgae-based treatment systems could be used as alternative treatment plants. In this study, a new design of semi-closed (hybrid) tubular horizontal photobioreactor (HTH-PBR) with low energy requirements has been evaluated for microalgae cultivation at full-scale (8.5 m3), using agricultural runoff as feedstock. This novel system was tested in batch and continuous mode during a total of 4 and 135 days. Considering a full-scale application in an agricultural context, a batch test was carried out to evaluate the performance of the system. An increase of 22% in the biomass concentration in 4 days was registered, and all nutrients were consumed during the first two days. In the continuous experiment (December- April), a productivity between 2-14 g TSS/m3d was reached in winter, whereas values up to 76.4 g TSS/m3d were reached at the end of the study in spring, despite the low nutrients concentration in the feedstock. The elimination of emerging contaminants was also evaluated, obtaining the highest removals for the fragrances tonalide and galaxolide (73% and 68%), and the antiinflamatory diclofenac (61%).\nA Scalable Machine Learning System for Pre-Season Agriculture Yield Forecast\t\"Igor Oliveira, \n      \n      Renato L.

To bring scalability for yield forecast, in the present paper we describe a system that incorporates satellite-derived precipitation and soil properties datasets, seasonal climate forecasting data from physical models and other sources to produce a pre-season prediction of soybean/maize yield---with no need of NDVI data.

It supports a food chain that generates over £108bn p.a., with 3.9m employees in a truly international industry and exports £20bn of UK manufactured goods. However, the global food chain is under pressure from population growth, climate change, political pressures affecting migration, population drift from rural to urban regions and the demographics of an aging global population. These challenges are recognised in the UK Industrial Strategy white paper and backed by significant investment via a Wave 2 Industrial Challenge Fund Investment (\"Transforming Food Production: from Farm to Fork\"). Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) and associated digital technologies are now seen as enablers of this critical food chain transformation. To meet these challenges, this white paper reviews the state of the art in the application of RAS in Agri-Food production and explores research and innovation needs to ensure these technologies reach their full potential and deliver the necessary impacts in the Agri-Food sector.\nEstimating Trade-Related Adjustment Costs in the Agricultural Sector in Iran\t\"Omid Karami, \n      \n      Mina Mahmoudi\"\t2018/06/11\tTariff liberalization and its impact on tax revenue is an important consideration for developing countries, because they are increasingly facing the difficult task of implementing and harmonizing regional and international trade commitments. The tariff reform and its costs for Iranian government is one of the issues that are examined in this study. Another goal of this paper is, estimating the cost of trade liberalization. On this regard, imports value of agricultural sector in Iran in 2010 was analyzed according to two scenarios. For reforming nuisance tariff, a VAT policy is used in both scenarios. In this study, TRIST method is used. In the first scenario, imports' value decreased to a level equal to the second scenario and higher tariff revenue will be created. The results show that reducing the average tariff rate does not always result in the loss of tariff revenue. This paper is a witness that different forms of tariff can generate different amount of income when they have same level of liberalization and equal effect on producers. Therefore, using a good tariff regime can help a government to generate income when increases social welfare by liberalization.\nThe Role of Agricultural Sector Productivity in Economic Growth: The Case of Iran's Economic Development Plan\t\"Morteza Tahamipour, \n      \n      Mina Mahmoudi\"\t2018/06/11\tThis study provides the theoretical framework and empirical model for productivity growth evaluations in agricultural sector as one of the most important sectors in Iran's economic development plan. We use the Solow residual model to measure the productivity growth share in the value-added growth of the agricultural sector. Our time series data includes value-added per worker, employment, and capital in this sector. The results show that the average total factor productivity growth rate in the agricultural sector is -0.72% during 1991-2010. Also, during this period, the share of total factor productivity growth in the value-added growth is -19.6%, while it has been forecasted to be 33.8% in the fourth development plan. Considering the effective role of capital in the agricultural low productivity, we suggest applying productivity management plans (especially in regards of capital productivity) to achieve future growth goals.\nA Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network Platform for Environmental Event Detection Dedicated to Precision Agriculture\t\"Hongling Shi, \n      \n      Kun Mean Hou, \n      \n      Xunxing Diao, \n      \n      Liu Xing, \n      \n      Jian-Jin Li, \n      \n      Christophe De Vaulx\"\t2018/05/15\tPrecision agriculture has been considered as a new technique to improve agricultural production and support sustainable development by preserving planet resource and minimizing pollution.

By monitoring different parameters of interest in a cultivated field, wireless sensor network (WSN) enables real-time decision making with regard to issues such as management of water resources for irrigation, choosing the optimum point for harvesting, estimating fertilizer requirements and predicting crop yield more accurately. In spite the tremendous advanced of scalar WSN in recent year, scalar WSN cannot meet all the requirements of ubiquitous intelligent environmental event detections because scalar data such as temperature, soil humidity, air humidity and light intensity are not rich enough to detect all the environmental events such as plant diseases and present of insects. Thus to fulfill those requirements multimedia data is needed. In this paper we present a robust multi-support and modular Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN) platform, which is a type of wireless sensor network equipped with a low cost CCD camera. This WMSN platform may be used for diverse environmental event detections such as the presence of plant diseases and insects in precision agriculture applications.\nForecasting the sustainable status of the labor market in agriculture\t\"O.

Agricultural applications benefit from both advances, as they are in reality mobile driving factories which process the environment. Therefore, acurate perception of the surrounding is a crucial task as it involves the goods to be processed, in contrast to standard indoor production lines. Environmental processing requires accurate and robust quantification in order to correctly adjust processing parameters and detect hazardous risks during the processing. While today approaches still implement functional elements based on a single particular set of sensors, it may become apparent that a unified representation of the environment compiled from all available information sources would be more versatile, sufficient, and cost effective. The key to this approach is the means of developing a common information language from the data provided. In this paper, we introduce and discuss techniques to build so called inverse sensor models that create a common information language among different, but typically agricultural, information providers. These can be current live sensor data, farm management systems, or long term information generated from previous processing, drones, or satellites. In the context of Industry 4.0, this enables the interoperability of different agricultural systems and allows information transparency.\nDoes agricultural subsidies foster Italian southern farms? A Spatial Quantile Regression Approach\t\"Marusca De Castris, \n      \n      Daniele Di Gennaro\"\t2018/03/15\tDuring the last decades, public policies become a central pillar in supporting and stabilising agricultural sector. In 1962, EU policy-makers developed the so-called Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to ensure competitiveness and a common market organisation for agricultural products, while 2003 reform decouple the CAP from the production to focus only on income stabilization and the sustainability of agricultural sector. Notwithstanding farmers are highly dependent to public support, literature on the role played by the CAP in fostering agricultural performances is still scarce and fragmented. Actual CAP policies increases performance differentials between Northern Central EU countries and peripheral regions. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of CAP in stimulate performances by focusing on Italian lagged Regions. Moreover, agricultural sector is deeply rooted in place-based production processes. In this sense, economic analysis which omit the presence of spatial dependence produce biased estimates of the performances. Therefore, this paper, using data on subsidies and economic results of farms from the RICA dataset which is part of the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), proposes a spatial Augmented Cobb-Douglas Production Function to evaluate the effects of subsidies on farm's performances. The major innovation in this paper is the implementation of a micro-founded quantile version of a spatial lag model to examine how the impact of the subsidies may vary across the conditional distribution of agricultural performances. Results show an increasing shape which switch from negative to positive at the median and becomes statistical significant for higher quantiles. Additionally, spatial autocorrelation parameter is positive and significant across all the conditional distribution, suggesting the presence of significant spatial spillovers in agricultural performances.\nAn Effective Multi-Cue Positioning System for Agricultural Robotics\t\"Marco Imperoli, \n      \n      Ciro Potena, \n      \n      Daniele Nardi, \n      \n      Giorgio Grisetti, \n      \n      Alberto Pretto\"\t2018/09/11\tThe self-localization capability is a crucial component for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) in farming applications.

By modeling the pose estimation problem as a pose graph optimization, our approach simultaneously mitigates the cumulative drift introduced by motion estimation systems (wheel odometry, visual odometry, ...), and the noise introduced by raw GPS readings.

We show that our approach provides accurate results even if the GPS unexpectedly changes positioning mode.

Hameed\"\t2018/02/17\tThis paper describes a collaborative modelling approach to automated and robotic agricultural vehicle design. The Cresendo technology allows engineers from different disciplines to collaborate and produce system models. The combined models are called co-models and their execution co-simulation. To support future development efforts a template library of different vehicle and controllers types are provided. This paper describes a methodology to developing co-models from initial problem definition to deployment of the actual system. We illustrate the development methodology with an example development case from the agricultural domain. The case relates to an encountered speed controller problem on a differential driven vehicle, where we iterate through different candidate solutions and end up with an adaptive controller solution based on a combination of classical control and learning feedforward. The second case is an example of combining human control interface and co-simulation of agricultural robotic operation to illustrate collaborative development\nSeasonal Stochastic Volatility and the Samuelson Effect in Agricultural Futures Markets\t\"Lorenz Schneider, \n      \n      Bertrand Tavin\"\t2018/11/22\tWe introduce a multi-factor stochastic volatility model for commodities that incorporates seasonality and the Samuelson effect. Conditions on the seasonal term under which the corresponding volatility factor is well-defined are given, and five different specifications of the seasonality pattern are proposed. We calculate the joint characteristic function of two futures prices for different maturities in the risk-neutral measure. The model is then presented under the physical measure, and its state-space representation is derived, in order to estimate the parameters with the Kalman filter for time series of corn, cotton, soybean, sugar and wheat futures from 2007 to 2017. The seasonal model significantly outperforms the nested non-seasonal model in all five markets, and we show which seasonality patterns are particularly well-suited in each case. We also confirm the importance of correctly modelling the Samuelson effect in order to account for futures with different maturities. Our results are clearly confirmed in a robustness check carried out with an alternative dataset of constant maturity futures for the same agricultural markets.\nEvolutionary model discovery of causal factors behind the socio-agricultural behavior of the ancestral Pueblo\t\"Chathika Gunaratne, \n      \n      Ivan Garibay, \n      \n      Nguyen Dang\"\t2019/08/19\tAgent-based modeling of artificial societies offers a platform to test human-interpretable, causal explanations of human behavior that generate society-scale phenomena. However, parameter calibration is insufficient to conduct an adequate data-driven exploration of the importance of causal factors that constitute agent rules, resulting in models with limited causal accuracy and robustness. We introduce evolutionary model discovery, a framework that combines genetic programming and random forest regression to evaluate the importance of a set of causal factors hypothesized to affect the individual's decision-making process. We investigated the farm plot seeking behavior of the ancestral Pueblo of the Long House Valley simulated in the Artificial Anasazi model our proposed framework. We evaluated the importance of causal factors not considered in the original model that we hypothesized to have affected the decision-making process. Contrary to the original model, where closeness was the sole factor driving farm plot selection, selection of higher quality land and desire for social presence are shown to be more important. In fact, model performance is improved when agents select farm plots further away from their failed farm plot. Farm selection strategies designed using these insights into the socio-agricultural behavior of the ancestral Pueblo significantly improved the model's accuracy and robustness.\nReal-time Semantic Segmentation of Crop and Weed for Precision Agriculture Robots Leveraging Background Knowledge in CNNs\t\"Andres Milioto, \n      \n      Philipp Lottes, \n      \n      Cyrill Stachniss\"\t2018/03/02\tPrecision farming robots, which target to reduce the amount of herbicides that need to be brought out in the fields, must have the ability to identify crops and weeds in real time to trigger weeding actions. In this paper, we address the problem of CNN-based semantic segmentation of crop fields separating sugar beet plants, weeds, and background solely based on RGB data. We propose a CNN that exploits existing vegetation indexes and provides a classification in real time. Furthermore, it can be effectively re-trained to so far unseen fields with a comparably small amount of training data. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our system on a real agricultural robot operating in different fields in Germany and Switzerland. The results show that our system generalizes well, can operate at around 20Hz, and is suitable for online operation in the fields.\nFrom Plants to Landmarks: Time-invariant Plant Localization that uses Deep Pose Regression in Agricultural Fields\t\"Florian Kraemer, \n      \n      Alexander Schaefer, \n      \n      Andreas Eitel,",

At the same time, they move in a continuously changing, semi-structured field environment, in which features can hardly be found and reproduced at a later time. Challenges for Lidar and visual detection systems stem from the fact that plants can be very small, overlapping and have a steadily changing appearance. Therefore, a popular way to localize vehicles with high accuracy is based on ex- pensive global navigation satellite systems and not on natural landmarks. The contribution of this work is a novel image- based plant localization technique that uses the time-invariant stem emerging point as a reference. Our approach is based on a fully convolutional neural network that learns landmark localization from RGB and NIR image input in an end-to-end manner. The network performs pose regression to generate a plant location likelihood map. Our approach allows us to cope with visual variances of plants both for different species and different growth stages. We achieve high localization accuracies as shown in detailed evaluations of a sugar beet cultivation phase. In experiments with our BoniRob we demonstrate that detections can be robustly reproduced with centimeter accuracy.\nFieldSAFE: Dataset for Obstacle Detection in Agriculture\t\"Mikkel Fly Kragh, \n      \n      Peter Christiansen, \n      \n      Morten Stigaard Laursen, \n      \n      Morten Larsen, \n      \n      Kim Arild Steen, \n      \n      Ole Green, \n      \n      Henrik Karstoft, \n      \n      Rasmus Nyholm Jørgensen\"\t2017/09/11\tIn this paper, we present a novel multi-modal dataset for obstacle detection in agriculture.

Here we present the NREC Agricultural Person-Detection Dataset to spur research in these environments. It consists of labeled stereo video of people in orange and apple orchards taken from two perception platforms (a tractor and a pickup truck), along with vehicle position data from RTK GPS. We define a benchmark on part of the dataset that combines a total of 76k labeled person images and 19k sampled person-free images. The dataset highlights several key challenges of the domain, including varying environment, substantial occlusion by vegetation, people in motion and in non-standard poses, and people seen from a variety of distances; meta-data are included to allow targeted evaluation of each of these effects. Finally, we present baseline detection performance results for three leading approaches from urban pedestrian detection and our own convolutional neural network approach that benefits from the incorporation of additional image context. We show that the success of existing approaches on urban data does not transfer directly to this domain.\nPersonal Food Computer: A new device for controlled-environment agriculture\t\"Eduardo Castelló Ferrer, \n      \n      Jake Rye, \n      \n      Gordon Brander, \n      \n      Tim Savas, \n      \n      Douglas Chambers, \n      \n      Hildreth England, \n      \n      Caleb Harper\"\t2017/06/24\tDue to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for controlled-environment agriculture have the possibility to turn into ideal tools not only to conduct research on plant phenology but also to create curricula in a wide range of disciplines.

From agricultural production to food supply, agriculture supports rural and urban economies across the U.S. It accounts for 10% of U.S. jobs and is currently creating new jobs in the growing field of data-driven farming. However, U.S. global competitiveness associated with food and nutrition security is at risk because of accelerated investments by many other countries in agriculture, food, energy, and resource management. To ensure U.S. global competitiveness and long-term food security, it is imperative that we build sustainable physical and cyber infrastructures to enable self-managing and sustainable farming. Such infrastructures should enable next generation precision-farms by harnessing modern and emerging technologies such as small satellites, broadband Internet, tele-operation, augmented reality, advanced data analytics, sensors, and robotics.\nCoupling of Crop Assignment and Vehicle Routing for Harvest Planning in Agriculture\tMogens Graf Plessen\t2019/07/24\tA method for harvest planning based on the coupling of crop assignment with vehicle routing is presented. Given a setting with multiple fields, a path network connecting these, multiple depots at which a number of harvesters are initially located, the main question addressed is: Which crop out of a set of different crops to assign to each field when accounting for the given setting? It must be answered by every farm manager at the beginning of every work-cycle starting with plant seeding and ending with harvesting. Rather than solving an assignment problem only, it is here also accounted for the connectivity between fields. In practice, fields are often located distant apart. Traveling costs of machinery and limited harvesting windows demand optimised operation and route planning. Therefore, the proposed method outputs crop assignments to fields and simultaneously determines crop-tours, i.e., optimised sequences in which to service fields of the same crop during harvest. It is of particular relevance for larger farms and groups of farms that collaborate and share machinery. Integer programming based exact algorithms are derived. For large numbers of fields, where these algorithms may not be tractable due to computational constraints, elements of clustering and the solution of local Traveling Salesman Problems are added, thereby on the one hand rendering the method heuristic and in general suboptimal, but on the other hand maintaining large-scale applicability.\nAn association between information and communication technology and agriculture knowledge management process in Indian milk co-operatives and non-profit organizations: an empirical analysis\t\"Ram Naresh Kumar Vangala, \n      \n      Asim Banerjee, \n      \n      B N Hiremath\"\t2017/02/12\tThe purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between information and communication technology (ICT) and knowledge management processes (KM process) in Indian milk co-operatives and non-government organizations. Both qualitative and quantitative methods have been adopted in this study. Data were collected using questionnaires from 275 members working in both milk co-operatives and non-profit organizations (NGOs). The analysis and hypotheses testing were implemented using structural equation modeling technique (SEM). The results showed that ICT has significant (at p = 0.001) and positive effect on KM processes. The results obtained would help managers to better understand the linkage between ICT and KM processes. They could use the results to improve their ICT (tools and infrastructure) for improving the efficiency of KM process in their organizations. The proposed set of metrics could be used as common tools to measure the performance of ICT in KM process in agriculture organizations and for future research.\nTowards Unsupervised Weed Scouting for Agricultural Robotics\t\"David Hall, \n      \n      Feras Dayoub, \n      \n      Jason Kulk, \n      \n      Chris McCool\"\t2017/02/25\tWeed scouting is an important part of modern integrated weed management but can be time consuming and sparse when performed manually. Automated weed scouting and weed destruction has typically been performed using classification systems able to classify a set group of species known a priori. This greatly limits deployability as classification systems must be retrained for any field with a different set of weed species present within them. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper works towards developing a clustering approach to weed scouting which can be utilized in any field without the need for prior species knowledge. We demonstrate our system using challenging data collected in the field from an agricultural robotics platform. We show that considerable improvements can be made by (i) learning low-dimensional (bottleneck) features using a deep convolutional neural network to represent plants in general and (ii) tying views of the same area (plant) together. Deploying this algorithm on in-field data collected by AgBotII, we are able to successfully cluster cotton plants from grasses without prior knowledge or training for the specific plants in the field.\nA Revolutionary Rural Agricultural Participatory Sensing Approach Using Delay Tolerant Networks\t\"Prateek Gupta, \n      \n      Bhushan Jagyasi, \n      \n      Bighnaraj Panigrahi, \n      \n      Hemant Kumar Rath, \n      \n      Srinivasu Pappula, \n      \n      Anantha Simha\"\t2016/12/09\tTo provide sustainable",

The query generated by the farmers, which may contain multimedia data regarding disease or pest attack in the crops is required to be transmitted to the experts for analysis. Further, after analyzing the query, an alert or advice from the expert system is required to be communicated back to the farmers within some tolerable delay. However, in a country like India, network connectivity is extremely poor in several agricultural regions which makes the end-to-end connectivity between the farmers and the expert system intermittent. Therefore, providing agro-advisory services to farmers in a reasonable time becomes a challenge. In this paper, we propose a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) based relay application model which enables agro-advisory services to farmers located in \\emph{No-network} or \\emph{Poor-network} zones. In the proposed model, end-to-end communication has been enabled with the help of Device to Device (D2D) communication and by introducing mobile relay nodes which can carry the queries (responses), from (to) the poor or no network zones to (from) the zones where communication is possible. Implementation of this model has been presented for the tea farmers of West Bengal and Assam, which can be extended for various other applications in future.\nUnderstanding the Non-Convergence of Agricultural Futures via Stochastic Storage Costs and Timing Options\t\"Kevin Guo, \n      \n      Tim Leung\"\t2017/04/11\tThis paper studies the market phenomenon of non-convergence between futures and spot prices in the grains market. We postulate that the positive basis observed at maturity stems from the futures holder's timing options to exercise the shipping certificate delivery item and subsequently liquidate the physical grain. In our proposed approach, we incorporate stochastic spot price and storage cost, and solve an optimal double stopping problem to give the optimal strategies to exercise and liquidate the grain. Our new models for stochastic storage rates lead to explicit no-arbitrage prices for the shipping certificate and associated futures contract. We calibrate our models to empirical futures data during the periods of observed non-convergence, and illustrate the premium generated by the shipping certificate.\n4D Crop Monitoring: Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction for Agriculture\t\"Jing Dong, \n      \n      John Gary Burnham, \n      \n      Byron Boots, \n      \n      Glen C. Rains, \n      \n      Frank Dellaert\"\t2016/10/08\tAutonomous crop monitoring at high spatial and temporal resolution is a critical problem in precision agriculture. While Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereo algorithms can finely reconstruct the 3D structure of a field with low-cost image sensors, these algorithms fail to capture the dynamic nature of continuously growing crops. In this paper we propose a 4D reconstruction approach to crop monitoring, which employs a spatio-temporal model of dynamic scenes that is useful for precision agriculture applications. Additionally, we provide a robust data association algorithm to address the problem of large appearance changes due to scenes being viewed from different angles at different points in time, which is critical to achieving 4D reconstruction. Finally, we collected a high quality dataset with ground truth statistics to evaluate the performance of our method. We demonstrate that our 4D reconstruction approach provides models that are qualitatively correct with respect to visual appearance and quantitatively accurate when measured against the ground truth geometric properties of the monitored crops.\nModelling the impact of financialization on agricultural commodity markets\t\"Maria d'Errico, \n      \n      Alessandro Laio, \n      \n      Guido L. Chiarotti\"\t2016/07/26\tWe propose a stylized model of production and exchange in which long-term investors set their production decision over a horizon τ , the \"time to produce\", and are liquidity constrained, while financial investors trade over a much shorter horizon δ (<< τ ) and are therefore more duly informed on the exogenous shocks affecting the production output. The equilibrium solution proves that: (i) long-term producers modify their production decisions to anticipate the impact of short-term investors allocations on prices; (ii) short-term investments return a positive expected profit commensurate to the informational advantage. While the presence of financial investors improves the efficiency of risk allocation in the short-term and reduces price volatility, the model shows that the aggregate effect of commodity market financialization results in rising the volatility of both farms' default risk and production output.\nA hybrid heuristic algorithm with application to a graphical interface for vehicle routing optimization in an agricultural cooperative\t\"Roque M.

Global agricultural networks are well-described by power law rank-size distributions. However, regional analyses capture only a subset of the total global network. Most analyses are regional. In this paper, we seek to address the following questions: Does the globally observed scale-free property of agricultural networks hold over smaller spatial domains? Can similar properties be observed at kilometer to meter scales? We analyze 9 intensively cultivated Landsat scenes on 5 continents with a wide range of vegetation distributions. We find that networks of vegetation fraction within the domain of each of these Landsat scenes exhibit substantial variability - but still possess similar scaling properties to the global distribution of agriculture. We also find similar results using a 39 km2 IKONOS image. To illustrate an application of spatial network analysis, we show an example of network disruption. We compare two networks with similar rank-size distributions that behave differently when nodes are progressively removed. We suggest that treating agricultural land cover as spatial networks can provide a straightforward way of characterizing the connectivity of complex spatial distributions of agriculture across a wide range of landscapes and at spatial scales relevant for practical agricultural applications.\nAgri-Info: Cloud Based Autonomic System for Delivering Agriculture as a Service\t\"Sukhpal Singh, \n      \n      Inderveer Chana, \n      \n      Rajkumar Buyya\"\t2015/11/29\tCloud computing has emerged as an important paradigm for managing and delivering services efficiently over the Internet. Convergence of cloud computing with technologies such as wireless sensor networking and mobile computing offers new applications of cloud services but this requires management of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to efficiently monitor and measure the delivered services. This paper presents a QoS-aware Cloud Based Autonomic Information System for delivering agriculture related information as a service through the use of latest Cloud technologies which manage various types of agriculture related data based on different domains. Proposed system gathers information from various users through preconfigured devices and manages and provides required information to users automatically. Further, Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm has been used for efficient resource allocation at infrastructure level for effective utilization of resources. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed approach in Cloud environment and experimental results show that the proposed system performs better in terms of resource utilization, execution time, cost and computing capacity along with other QoS parameters.\nRSSI-Based Distributed Self-Localization for Wireless Sensor Networks used in Precision Agriculture\t\"Pooyan Abouzar, \n      \n      David G. Michelson, \n      \n      Maziyar Hamdi\"\t2015/08/21\tNode localization algorithms that can be easily integrated into deployed wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and which run seamlessly with proprietary lower layer communication protocols running on off-the-shelf modules can help operators of large farms and orchards avoid the difficulty, cost and/or time involved with manual or satellite-based node localization techniques. Even though the state-of-the-art node localization algorithms can achieve low error rates using distributed techniques such as belief propagation (BP), they are not well suited to WSNs deployed for precision agriculture applications with large number of nodes, few number of landmarks and lack real time update capability. The algorithm proposed here is designed for applications such as pest control and irrigation in large farms and orchards where greater power efficiency and scalability are required but location accuracy requirements are less demanding. Our algorithm uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values to estimate the distribution of distance between nodes then updates the location probability mass function (pmf) of nodes in a distributed manner. At every time step, the most recently communicated path loss samples and location prior pmf received from neighbouring nodes is sufficient for nodes with unknown location to update their location pmf. This renders the algorithm recursive, hence results in lower computational complexity at each time step. We propose a particular realization of the method in which only one node multicasts at each time step and neighbouring nodes update their location pmf conditioned on all communicated samples over previous time steps. This is highly compatible with realistic WSN deployments, e.g., ZigBee which are based upon the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) where nodes flood route request (RREQ) and route reply (RREP) packets in the network.\nProductivity of pre-modern agriculture in the Cucuteni-Trypillia area\t\"A.

Our conclusions involve analysis of the labour costs of the agricultural cycle of both an individual and a farmer's family. Finally, we put our results into the context of the exploitation territory and catchment analysis. The simplest economic complex based on cereals, domestic and wild animal products, with fallow cropping, appears to be capable of supporting an isolated, relatively small farming community of 50-300 people (2-10 ha). Our results strongly suggest that dairy products played a significant role in the dietary and labour balance. The smaller settlements are typical of the earliest Trypillia A but remain predominant at the later stages. A larger settlement of several hundred people could function in isolation only with technological innovations, such as manure fertiliser and ard tillage. Very large settlements of a few hundred hectares could function only if supported by satellite farming villages and stable exchange networks. We also discuss, quantify and assess some strategies to mitigate the risks of arable agriculture associated with strong temporal fluctuations in the cereal yield, such as manure fertilisation, increased fraction of cereals in the diet combined with producing grain surplus for emergency storage.\nLow Cost Semi-Autonomous Agricultural Robots In Pakistan-Vision Based Navigation Scalable methodology for wheat harvesting\t\"Muhammad Zubair Ahmad, \n      \n      Ayyaz Akhtar, \n      \n      Abdul Qadeer Khan, \n      \n      Amir Ali Khan, \n      \n      Muhammad Murtaza Khan\"\t2015/01/10\tRobots have revolutionized our way of life in recent years.One of the domains that has not yet completely benefited from the robotic automation is the agricultural sector. Agricultural Robotics should complement humans in the arduous tasks during different sub-domains of this sector. Extensive research in Agricultural Robotics has been carried out in Japan, USA, Australia and Germany focusing mainly on the heavy agricultural machinery. Pakistan is an agricultural rich country and its economy and food security are closely tied with agriculture in general and wheat in particular. However, agricultural research in Pakistan is still carried out using the conventional methodologies. This paper is an attempt to trigger the research in this modern domain so that we can benefit from cost effective and resource efficient autonomous agricultural methodologies. This paper focuses on a scalable low cost semi-autonomous technique for wheat harvest which primarily focuses on the farmers with small land holdings. The main focus will be on the vision part of the navigation system deployed by the proposed robot.\nMonitoring of saline tracer movement with vertically distributed self-potential measurements at the HOBE agricultural test site, Voulund, Denmark\t\"Damien Jougnot, \n      \n      Niklas Linde, \n      \n      Eline B. Haarder, \n      \n      Majken C. Looms\"\t2015/01/09\tThe self-potential (SP) method is sensitive to water fluxes in saturated and partially saturated porous media, such as those associated with rainwater infiltration and groundwater recharge. We present a field-based study at the Voulund agricultural test site, Denmark, that is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to focus on the vertical self-potential distribution prior to and during a saline tracer test. A coupled hydrogeophysical modeling framework is used to simulate the SP response to precipitation and saline tracer infiltration. A layered hydrological model is first obtained by inverting dielectric and matric potential data. The resulting model that compares favorably with electrical resistance tomography models is subsequently used to predict the SP response. The electrokinetic contribution (caused by water fluxes in a charged porous soil) is modeled by an effective excess charge approach that considers both water saturation and pore water salinity. Our results suggest that the effective excess charge evolution prior to the tracer injection is better described by a recent flux-averaged model based on soil water retention functions than by a previously proposed volume-averaging model. This is the first time that raw vertically distributed SP measurements have been explained by a physically based model. The electrokinetic contribution cannot alone reproduce the SP data during the tracer test and an electro-diffusive contribution (caused by concentration gradients) is needed. The predicted amplitude of this contribution is too small to perfectly explain the data, but the shape is in accordance with the field data. This discrepancy is attributed to imperfect descriptions of electro-diffusive phenomena in partially saturated soils, unaccounted soil heterogeneity, and discrepancies between the measured and predicted electrical conductivities in the tracer infiltration area.\nAdaptive Market Efficiency of Agricultural Commodity Futures Contracts\t\"Semei Coronado-Ramírez, \n      \n      Pedro Celso-Arellano, \n      \n      Omar Rojas\"\t2015/03/31\tIn this paper we investigate the adaptive market efficiency of the agricultural commodity futures market, using a sample of eight futures contracts.

This problem is discussed in the point of the retailer. When spot market and future market are both available, we discuss how the retailer chooses the optimal production. Furthermore, overconfidence is introduced to the supply chain of the fresh agricultural products, which has not happened before. Then,based on the overconfidence of the retailer, we explore how overconfidence affects the supply chain system under different circumstances. At last, we get the conclusion that different overconfidence level has different affection on retailer's optimal ordering quantity and profit.\nAgriculture driving male expansion in Neolithic Time\t\"Chuan-Chao Wang, \n      \n      Yunzhi Huang, \n      \n      Shao-Qing Wen, \n      \n      Chun Chen, \n      \n      Li Jin, \n      \n      Hui Li\"\t2013/11/26\tThe emergence of agriculture is suggested to have driven extensive human population growths. However, genetic evidence from maternal mitochondrial genomes suggests major population expansions began before the emergence of agriculture. Therefore, role of agriculture that played in initial population expansions still remains controversial. Here, we analyzed a set of globally distributed whole Y chromosome and mitochondrial genomes of 526 male samples from 1000 Genome Project. We found that most major paternal lineage expansions coalesced in Neolithic Time. The estimated effective population sizes through time revealed strong evidence for 10- to 100-fold increase in population growth of males with the advent of agriculture. This sex-biased Neolithic expansion might result from the reduction in hunting-related mortality of males.\nUsing a complex system approach to address world challenges in Food and Agriculture\t\"H.

It also has a profound impact on the world economy, international trade and global political stability. Furthermore, consumption of certain types and amounts foods can affect health, and the choice of livestock and plants for food production can impact sustainable use of global resources. There are communities where insufficient food causes nutritional deficiencies, and at the same time other communities eating too much food leading to obesity and accompanying diseases. These aspects reflect the utmost importance of agricultural production and conversion of commodities to food products. Moreover, all factors contributing to the food supply are interdependent, and they are an integrative part of the continuously changing, adaptive and interdependent systems in the world around us. The properties of such interdependent systems usually cannot be inferred from the properties of its parts. In addressing current challenges, like the apparent incongruences of obesity and hunger, we have to account for the complex interdependencies among areas such as physics and sociology. This is possible using the complex system approach. It encompasses an integrative multi-scale and inter-disciplinary approach. Using a complex system approach that accounts for the needs of stakeholders in the agriculture and food domain, and determines which research programs will enable these stakeholders to better anticipate emerging developments in the world around them, will enable them to determine effective intervention strategies to simultaneously optimise and safeguard their interests and the interests of the environment.\nInformation Transfer in the Agricultural Sector in Spain\t\"Antonio Munoz-Canavate, \n      \n      Pedro Hipola\"\t2013/03/09\t\"This article examines the structures of information transfer to the agricultural (production) and agro-alimentary (transformation and commercialization of the products) sector within Spain. An historical perspective is provided to better illustrate the reality and complexity of Spain with regard to the systems of agrarian extension, agricultural research, the resources provided by Spain's central administration, and the use of information by related enterprises.\n  The Service of Agrarian Extension appeared in Spain in the 1950s, and new political-administrative structures (agribusiness associations, cooperatives) were founded when Spain became a democratic nation in the late 1970s and with the arrival of electronic information, largely in the 1990s. We describe the research and technological centers supporting innovation in the agro-alimentary sector and the communication media dedicated to the agricultural sector. The article illustrates that the systems of agricultural information in Spain have been largely derived from initiatives of the Public Administration, with few private initiatives.\"\nOn Possible Influence of Space Weather on Agricultural Markets: Necessary Conditions and Probable Scenarios\t\"Lev Pustilnik, \n      \n      Gregory Yom Din\"\t2013/01/27\tWe present the results of study of a possible relationship between the space weather and terrestrial markets of agricultural products.

It is shown that to implement the possible effect of space weather on the terrestrial harvests and prices, a simultaneous fulfillment of three conditions is required: 1) sensitivity of local weather (cloud cover, atmospheric circulation) to the state of space weather; 2) sensitivity of the area of specific agricultural crops to the weather anomalies (belonging to the area of risk farming); 3) relative isolation of the market, making it difficult to damp the price hikes by the external food supplies. Four possible scenarios of the market response to the modulations of local terrestrial weather via the solar activity are described. The data sources and analysis methods applied to detect this relationship are characterized. We describe the behavior of 22 European markets during the medieval period, in particular, during the Maunder minimum (1650-1715). We demonstrate a reliable manifestation of the influence of space weather on prices, discovered in the statistics of intervals between the price hikes and phase price asymmetry. We show that the effects of phase price asymmetry persist even during the early modern period in the U.S. in the production of the durum wheat. Within the proposed approach, we analyze the statistics of depopulation in the eighteenth and nineteenth century Iceland, induced by the famine due to a sharp livestock reduction owing to, in its turn, the lack of foodstuff due to the local weather anomalies. A high statistical significance of temporal matching of these events with the periods of extreme solar activity is demonstrated. We discuss the possible consequences of the observed global climate change in the formation of new areas of risk farming, sensitive to space weather.\nEnergy Aware Path Search for Sensor with parameters as used in agricultural field\t\"Smitha N.

This paper presents an agent-based model that simulates policy scenarios to characterize how the production of poppy can be dampened and replaced with licit crops over time. The model is initialized with spatial data, including transportation network and satellite-derived land use data. Parameters representing national subsidies, insurgent influence, and trafficking blockades are varied to represent different conditions that might encourage or discourage poppy agriculture. Our model shows that boundary-level interventions, such as targeted trafficking blockades at border locations, are critical in reducing the attractiveness of growing this illicit crop. The principle of least effort implies that interventions decrease to a minimal non-regressive point, leading to the prediction that increases in insurgency or other changes are likely to lead to worsening conditions, and improvements require substantial jumps in intervention resources.\nInformation Surfaces in Systems Biology and Applications to Engineering Sustainable Agriculture\t\"Hesam Dashti, \n      \n      Alireza Siahpirani, \n      \n      James Driver, \n      \n      Amir Assadi\"\t2011/10/19\tSystems biology of plants offers myriad opportunities and many challenges in modeling.

Information Surfaces organizes the many intricate relationships among \"eigen-modes\" of gene networks at multiple scales and via an adaptable multi-resolution analytic approach that permits discovery of the appropriate scale and resolution for discovery of functions of genes in the model plant Arabidopsis. Applications are many, and some pertain developments of crops that sustainable agriculture requires.\nNumerical study on transient heat transfer under soil with plastic mulch in agriculture applications using a nonlinear finite element model\t\"Carlos Armando De Castro, \n      \n      Orlando Porras Rey\"\t2011/10/07\tIn this paper is developed a simple mathematical model of transient heat transfer under soil with plastic mulch in order to determine with numerical studies the influence of different plastic mulches on the soil temperature and the evolutions of temperatures at different depths with time. The governing differential equations are solved by a Galerkin Finite Element Model, taking into account the nonlinearities due to radiative heat exchange between the soil surface, the plastic mulch and the atmosphere. The model was validated experimentally giving good approximation of the model to the measured data. Simulations were run with the validated model in order to determine the optimal combination of mulch optical properties to maximize the soil temperature with a Taguchi's analysis, proving that the material most used nowadays in Colombia is not the optimal and giving quantitative results of the properties the optimal mulch must possess.\nMalthusian assumptions, Boserupian response in models of the transitions to agriculture\tCarsten Lemmen\t2012/05/24\tIn the many transitions from foraging to agropastoralism it is debated whether the primary drivers are innovations in technology or increases of population.

The driver discussion traditionally separates Malthusian (technology driven) from Boserupian (population driven) theories. I present a numerical model of the transitions to agriculture and discuss this model in the light of the population versus technology debate and in Boserup's analytical framework in development theory. Although my model is based on ecological -Neomalthusian- principles, the coevolutionary positive feedback relationship between technology and population results in a seemingly Boserupian response: innovation is greatest when population pressure is highest. This outcome is not only visible in the theory-driven reduced model, but is also present in a corresponding \"real world\" simulator which was tested against archaeological data, demonstrating the relevance and validity of the coevolutionary model. The lesson to be learned is that not all that acts Boserupian needs Boserup at its core.\nExtreme Measures of Agricultural Financial Risk\t\"John Cotter, \n      \n      Kevin Dowd, \n      \n      Wyn Morgan\"\t2011/03/30\tRisk is an inherent feature of agricultural production and marketing and accurate measurement of it helps inform more efficient use of resources. This paper examines three tail quantile-based risk measures applied to the estimation of extreme agricultural financial risk for corn and soybean production in the US: Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES) and Spectral Risk Measures (SRMs). We use Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model the tail returns and present results for these three different risk measures using agricultural futures market data. We compare the estimated risk measures in terms of their size and precision, and find that they are all considerably higher than normal estimates; they are also quite uncertain, and become more uncertain as the risks involved become more extreme.\nComparing human and automatic thesaurus mapping approaches in the agricultural domain\t\"Boris Lauser, \n      \n      Gudrun Johannsen, \n      \n      Caterina Caracciolo, \n      \n      Johannes Keizer, \n      \n      Willem Robert van Hage, \n      \n      Philipp Mayr\"\t2008/08/16\tKnowledge organization systems (KOS), like thesauri and other controlled vocabularies, are used to provide subject access to information systems across the web. Due to the heterogeneity of these systems, mapping between vocabularies becomes crucial for retrieving relevant information. However, mapping thesauri is a laborious task, and thus big efforts are being made to automate the mapping process. This paper examines two mapping approaches involving the agricultural thesaurus AGROVOC, one machine-created and one human created. We are addressing the basic question \"What are the pros and cons of human and automatic mapping and how can they complement each other?\" By pointing out the difficulties in specific cases or groups of cases and grouping the sample into simple and difficult types of mappings, we show the limitations of current automatic methods and come up with some basic recommendations on what approach to use when.\nAnalysis of a Japan government intervention on the domestic agriculture market\t\"Nikolay K. Vitanov, \n      \n      Kenshi Sakai, \n      \n      Ivan P. Jordanov, \n      \n      Shunsuke Managi, \n      \n      Katsuhiko Demura\"\t2006/07/17\tWe investigate an economic system in which one large agent - the Japan government changes the environment of numerous smaller agents - the Japan agriculture producers by indirect regulation of prices of agriculture goods. The reason for this intervention was that before the oil crisis in 1974 Japan agriculture production prices exhibited irregular and large amplitude changes. By means of analysis of correlations and a combination of singular spectrum analysis (SSA), principal component analysis (PCA), and time delay phase space construction (TDPSC) we study the influence of the government measures on the domestic piglet prices and production in Japan. We show that the government regulation politics was successful and leaded (i) to a decrease of the nonstationarities and to increase of predictability of the piglet price; (ii) to a coupling of the price and production cycles; (iii) to increase of determinism of the dynamics of the fluctuations of piglet price around the year average price. The investigated case is an example confirming the thesis that a large agent can change in a significant way the environment of the small agents in complex (economic or financial) systems which can be crucial for their survival or extinction.\nApplications of Novel Techniques to Health Foods, Medical and Agricultural Biotechnology\t\"I.
